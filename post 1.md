# The NY Trip!

Category: Personal Blog
Date: May 23, 2011

So right now I am in the process of planning an amazing trip to the US. I am heading over for @[mikmorley](http://twitter.com/mikmorley)‘s wedding and then spending a week in New York with one of the best friends I’ve ever made – Ryan.

While in Las Vegas / Los Angeles there will be loads of people surrounding us, new people to meet, things to do, but for the second leg of the trip Ryan and I have decided to do something completely different.

We’re couch surfing baby, yeah! Ryan and I are hoping to find some awesome locals to meet while we’re there in order to be certain that we take in the true New York experience!

My main reason for this blog post is a bit of an introduction to potential couch-surfing hosts. Hopefully by reading back through this blog, reading my [twitter](http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&hl=en&site=&source=hp&q=mitch+malone&aq=f&aqi=g5&aql=&oq=&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&fp=27bb125b645400e6&biw=1280&bih=646) you can get a fair idea of who I am, but here is a bit of information about Ryan and I that I will be including in introduction emails.

**Mitch** – 28 years old, software engineer and graphic designer working for a technology startup in Sydney. Easy going and thoughtful, but a bit of a party-boy at heart, loves to have fun and good times. Listens to awful punk music, loves videogames, comic books, art, photography, the whole lot. Also a bit of a geek.

**Ryan** – 28 year old guy and my best friend. Also a bit of a party boy. Will make ANYONE laugh, will quote TV shows and movies non-stop, will likely keep the party going way too late, but a very thoughtful guy and knows when to stop also and how to respect others.
