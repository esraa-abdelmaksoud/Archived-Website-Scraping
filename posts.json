I am heading over for @[mikmorley](http://twitter.com/mikmorley)\u2018s wedding and then spending a week in New York with one of the best friends I\u2019ve ever made \u2013 Ryan.\n\nWhile in Las Vegas / Los Angeles there will be loads of people surrounding us, new people to meet, things to do, but for the second leg of the trip Ryan and I have decided to do something completely different.\n\nWe\u2019re couch surfing baby, yeah! Ryan and I are hoping to find some awesome locals to meet while we\u2019re there in order to be certain that we take in the true New York experience!\n\nMy main reason for this blog post is a bit of an introduction to potential couch-surfing hosts. Hopefully by reading back through this blog, reading my [twitter](http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&hl=en&site=&source=hp&q=mitch+malone&aq=f&aqi=g5&aql=&oq=&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&fp=27bb125b645400e6&biw=1280&bih=646) you can get a fair idea of who I am, but here is a bit of information about Ryan and I that I will be including in introduction emails.\n\n**Mitch** \u2013 28 years old, software engineer and graphic designer working for a technology startup in Sydney. Easy going and thoughtful, but a bit of a party-boy at heart, loves to have fun and good times. Listens to awful punk music, loves videogames, comic books, art, photography, the whole lot. Also a bit of a geek.\n\n**Ryan** \u2013 28 year old guy and my best friend. Also a bit of a party boy. Will make ANYONE laugh, will quote TV shows and movies non-stop, will likely keep the party going way too late, but a very thoughtful guy and knows when to stop also and how to respect others.\n\n[![The boys - all smiles, all the time!](http://www.bananasontoast.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/8919_135962119750_511589750_2555601_3153712_n.jpg \"The boys - all smiles, all the time!\")\n\n The boys \u2013 all smiles, all the time!\n\n[![Rocking, with a friend in between](http://www.bananasontoast.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/196373_4374568250_513418250_7956_2755_n.jpg \"Rocking, with a friend in between\")\n\n Rocking, with a friend in between\n\n[![Rocking, with a friend in between](http://www.bananasontoast.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/198201_4374663250_513418250_7975_8111_n.jpg \"Rocking, with a friend in between\")\n\n Rocking, with a friend in between\n\n[![The boys, living it up!

Happiness and success are two different things.\n\n3. Everyone runs their own business.\n\n4. Having too many choices interferes with decision making.\n\n5. All people possess dimensions of success and dimensions of failure.\n\n6. Every mistake you make is progress.\n\n7. People can be great at doing things they don\u2019t like to do.\n\n8. The problems we have with others are typically more about us.\n\n9. Emotional decisions are rarely good decisions.\n\n10.

A person from America knew of two friends who were migrating from Russia and had been caught up in a possible scam and put out the following call for help:\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> My friend and former student K arrived in DC yesterday, along with a friend. She came over on some kind of travel exchange program put together by a Russian travel agency called \u2018XXXXX\u2019. They paid about 3K for this program.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> The program promised a job offer in advance, but didn\u2019t deliver. They said they would send one via email, but failed there, too.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> Her contact in the USA barely speaks English, doesn\u2019t answer her calls but does answer mine. He has asked her and her friend to meet in NYC tonight around midnight, with promises of hostess work in a lounge. Yes, I know how horrific that sounds- that\u2019s why I am working all possible angles here.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> She is not going to NYC but I need some help handling and understanding how to handle this- I have a friend helping them with a cheap hotel for the night, but that\u2019s all at the moment. I am presently driving to LA and could fly her and her friend to meet me there on Saturday, but couldn\u2019t house them indefinitely. I will be monitoring this thread over the next hour.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\nvia [ask.metafilter.com](http://ask.metafilter.com/154334/Help-me-help-my-friend-in-DC)\n\nReading through the entire thread is like reading a crime novel and the poor guy truly is in distress over his friend and her traveling companion. It\u2019s quite a long thread and quite a read but I highly recommend taking a look at how the internet has changed their lives forever.",

                "text": "# What going home with a hooker taught me about my business\n\nCategory: Uncategorized\nDate: April 8, 2010\n\n **These nuggets of wisdom shared by a brothel worker are more useful than most pieces of business advice you\u2019ll read in a book.**\n\nBack in my days of crazy clubbing, I was talking to pretty much everyone in the nightclub (as you do) and met a chick with whom I quickly became friends. When the club closed in the early hours of the morning, she invited a bunch of us to go and hang out at her place.\n\nBack in her gorgeous apartment overlooking the water, we sat out on the balcony with her husband while her four-year-old daughter slept inside. In passing conversation, it came out that she worked in a brothel.\n\nI was fascinated by this \u2014 not so much by the industry, which I am in no way trying to glamorise \u2014 but by the fact she seemed to be relatively normal and not totally screwed up by the whole thing. So I asked her how she did it? How she managed to do her job and maintain a relationship with her husband? How she seemed to be so normal about the whole thing?\n\nAnd she said to me:\n\n### **\u201cI find something to love in every client.\u201d**\n\nThis blew me away. My initial reaction was, \u201cYou are a far better woman than me.\u201d\n\nThis conversation is something that\u2019s stuck with me over the 10 years since. It\u2019s something I think about often \u2014 when stuff gets bad in my business or I think I\u2019ve got it hard, I think back to meeting this chick \u2014 to what she must have been going through on a daily basis in order to do her job. And I realise that if *she* can find a way to love every client, I have no right to bitch or whine.\n\nThe further conversation that morning gave me even further distinctions that I\u2019ve carried forward into my business.\n\n### **Hookers aren\u2019t afraid of the money**\n\nIt\u2019s a cash-based transaction, baby. And if you don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s too bad. There are no freebies.\n\n### **Pimping 101**\n\nWhile hookers aren\u2019t afraid of the money \u2013 they also don\u2019t do their own sales. On the street it\u2019s the whole pimp culture thing. In a brothel, there\u2019s management. Either way, the girls aren\u2019t expected to do their own haggling. They provide service only.\n\n### **Hooker Syndrome**\n\nNot mine \u2014 this is an actual business syndrome, wherein any transaction is worth more to the purchaser *beforehand* than it is afterwards.\n\nGet your cash up-front and you don\u2019t have to worry about accounts \u2014 and you don\u2019t have to worry about chasing them afterwards.\n\n### **The Ultimate GFE**\n\nThere\u2019s this concept called the \u201cGFE\u201d \u2014 or Girl Friend Experience \u2014 wherein the client pays the hooker the compliment that being with her is like being with someone he isn\u2019t paying.\n\nAnd, of course, the girls foster this. They sell the guys what they want \u2014 the \u201cfantasy\u201d \u2014 and then give them the dream they\u2019re after \u2014 the \u201cGFE\u201d.\n\nBecause guys aren\u2019t really buying sex \u2014 they\u2019re buying the fantasy.\n\nSo what\u2019s the GFE in your business? What are your clients *really* buying? What do they get on forums and talk about behind your back? What do they say to their mates about you?\n\nWhen you know this, that\u2019s where the *real* marketing magic takes place.",

It\u2019s not because people are selfish (though they are) or shortsighted (though they are). It\u2019s because in this market, right now, they\u2019re not listening. They\u2019ve been seduced into believing that all options are the same, and they\u2019re only seeing price. In terms of educating the masses to differentiate yourself, the market is broken.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> Fixing this is almost always a losing battle.

                "text": "# $0 to $20 Million: Ten Hand-to-Hand Sales Tactics\n\nCategory: Uncategorized\nDate: January 12, 2010\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> *This guest post is written by [Matt Bell](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/12/its-all-about-selling-for-survival/) earlier this month.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> Technology blogs are full of advice for startups: [where to start a company](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/18/good-question-the-eight-best-questions-we-got-while-raising-venture-capital/) what makes strategic decisions meaningful: sales.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> A company with strong sales can build a great culture, hire anyone and take the time to figure out its strategy. Without sales, nothing else matters.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> There are a thousand books on how to sell everything from used cars to aluminum siding. But most never talk about the unique problem faced by startups: getting one crazy customer to spend money on a company that has a 50-50 shot at going out of business by year end.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> I have run sales organizations that couldn\u2019t sell diddly, and others that grew to $20 million. What I learned from both experiences is that even when the product works and plenty of people could use it, you can still fail if you don\u2019t get ferocious about finding your first customers.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> 1. **Be mutantly flexible**: The biggest advantage you have when competing with giants is just giving customers exactly what they want. Promise the moon then break down your CEO\u2019s door to make sure your customer gets it. Engineers can complain all they want after the fact, but most actually prefer rallying for a paying customer. Large competitors have to stick to rigid guidelines, satisfy dozens of constituencies in the install-base and within their own organization, and optimize for the masses. A startup\u2019s essential promise isn\u2019t to be like Hertz, which gets everything exactly right, but to be like Avis: we try harder.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> 2. **Juice the comp plan**: if you want capable, blood-thirsty reps, build a comp plan short on guarantees and big on incentives. High base salaries are for IBM\u2019s order-takers, not true hunters. You know you\u2019ve got it right when the rest of the management team is worried about a success-disaster: if we make our numbers, won\u2019t all the sales reps all get rich? That\u2019s a good problem to have. [Verdiem\u2019s](http://www.verdiem.com/)\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> Jim Flatley taught me this at [Plumtree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumtree_Software): he fought to get early reps 15% of every sale, but after we made our numbers for the first time ever, nobody wanted to pay them less. Even after the bubble burst and every other technology company took a blood-bath, Jim kept delivering results.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> 3. **Value speed in everything you do**: performance isn\u2019t just a characteristic of a technology; it\u2019s a characteristic of your entire organization, beginning with how quickly you respond to an inquiry or follow up on a presentation. If your argument is that your competitors are big, slow dinosaurs makes them look that way at every opportunity: whenever a prospect makes a request to you and your competitors, be the one who answers first.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> 4. **Plant landmines**: go first in customer presentations so you can set the terms of the debate. Prepare a list of questions for customers to ask your competitors. Customers won\u2019t trust whatever claims you make about yourself, and they don\u2019t like it when you attack competitors directly, but if you let them dig into competitors\u2019 weaknesses for themselves, it works. When selling a $3-million deal to [Boeing](http://www.boeing.com/), I included the questions to ask our competitors in a hand-out. Who knows what happened to that hand-out, but we came from far behind to win.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> 5. **Move in after the first date**: your first customers are your best sales people, so after the deal closes, you as a sales-person have to move in with that customer \u2014 not move on. Every customer who took a crazy risk on your little company has to be completely vindicated in that decision, enough so that he convinces the next customer to ignore the obvious risk of doing business with you. Most customers understand that their career depends on your ability to convince new customers to make the same decision they did, and so they are usually eager to help you out. References can also limit the scope of a startup\u2019s greatest sales enemy: proofs-of-concept. If references establish that the product generally works, you can focus the PoC on very specific concerns. At Azaleos, we have a customer who likes to brag that his team went out for drinks during a go-live rather than watching nervously from a server room.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> 6. **Stand tall**: Even if you have no right, work from the premise the customer needs you as much as you need the customer. If you don\u2019t have confidence in your solution, who will? Half of what a sales person brings to a start up is a little swagger. As long as you aren\u2019t obnoxious, customers like to buy from confident companies, and their procurement officers are trained to smell weakness. Riding up the elevator toward a negotiation with one of the world\u2019s largest banks, I decided to raise our walk-away price by $1 million. Everyone argued for a lower number to avoid jeopardizing the deal, but the higher number actually increased our chances. We got the deal for 30% above our walk-away price.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> 7. **Partner up**: No one gets fired for hiring [IBM](http://www.sap.com/), IBM. When trying to get in the door for an enterprise deal with a major transportation company, I spent nearly a month trying to convince \u2018em that a startup could handle a multi-million dollar project. Rightfully so, the customer said no way, until I reached out to Microsoft. Together, we got the deal.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> 8. **Involve everyone**: get as many of your executives, founders, engineers, product managers, and customer-service folks involved in the sales process as possible. You get better perspectives on the deal \u2013 a customer will level with an engineer in a way he might not with you \u2013 and it makes your company seem bigger to the customer. The customer develops relationships with people throughout your startup, and realizes there\u2019s more at stake than a greedy sales-person\u2019s commission. Focus on how much your whole startup cares about the individual customer; make your small size work for you by developing intimacy between your startup and the customer. This tactic works with large or small customers. I recommend having the CEO or another member of the executive staff make a personal phone call during the final decision process to pledge their commitment to the customer\u2019s success.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> 9. **Hire slow, fire fast**: you\u2019ll hire some folks who don\u2019t work out. If you wait to fire them, you\u2019ll run out of money, demoralize your top performers, and lose credibility. Three months after hiring a rep I asked him \u201chow long are you going to be comfortable not selling anything\u201d? His answer, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Matt, I can go several quarters without selling anything before I\u2019d start looking for a new job.\u201d We let him got the next day.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> 10. **Focus the sales pitch**: technology start ups are mostly driven by engineers in the early days. On hiring you, they\u2019ll expect you to start cold-calling the whole phonebook. And the truth is, you have to love cold-calling. After all these years, I still love it. But just like Dutch in Predator before the final battle, you have to be able to answer only one question about your target before you start: where they are. A sales force needs to know what kind of companies to call on and the title of the person to call within those companies. Then he needs a pitch that a ten year-old could understand.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\nvia [techcrunch.com](http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/06/0-to-20-million-ten-hand-to-hand-sales-tactics/?utm_source=Web&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29)",

                "text": "# Don\u2019t wait until your customer is thirsty\n\nCategory: Uncategorized\nDate: November 25, 2009\n\nAccording to most medical journals available \u201cby the time you feel thirsty you are already dehydrated \u2013 you want to avoid becoming thirsty in the first place.\u201d ([http://www.symptomsofdehydration.com/](http://www.symptomsofdehydration.com/ \"Signs And Symptoms Of Dehydration\"))\n\nMany sales and marketing strategies require clients or customers to already have a need and for the product or service to suit that need. Marketing collateral is sent out, advertising budgets are approved and spent, phone calls are made to enquire to see if clients have a need and the process is kept entirely reactive. \u201cI will be here when you decide you have a need.\u201d\n\nIn a lot of cases, by the time the need is recognised by the organisation it often feels too late. Their competitors have beaten them to market, their need is now so important that finding the solution is the only thing that matters. This is great if you are the only supplier of your product or service, or if you are lucky enough to be front of mind at the time. Or even luckier still is if you happen to call at the same time as the need is recognised. But this kind of luck seldom comes and hoping for it to pay off is the worst strategy of all.\n\nIf you wait for your customer to be thirsty, chances are they will be beyond thirst and their need will be so strong that winning their business is now down to chance. Instead, find the customers who are willing to recognise their thirst before it is a major business concern, help them to realise your partnership value and grow the relationship.",

                "text": "# How to lose an argument online\n\nCategory: Uncategorized\nDate: November 24, 2009\n\nOne of the biggest things I see people do online that just detracts from their personal brand is argue. My mother, the same as every other mother on the planet, used to tell me not to do this and I am sure she told you too. If you have nothing nice to say, don\u2019t say anything at all\n\n>\n\n> 1. **Have an argument.** Once you start an argument, not a discussion, you\u2019ve already lost. Think about it: have you ever changed your mind because someone online started yelling at you? They might get you to shut up, but it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ve actually changed your opinion.\n\n> 2. **Forget the pitfalls of Godwin\u2019s law.** Any time you mention Hitler or even Communist China or Bill O\u2019Reilly, you\u2019ve lost.\n\n> 3. **Use faulty analogies**. If someone is trying to make a point about, say, health care, try to make an analogy to something conceptually unrelated, like the space shuttle program, and you\u2019ve lost.\n\n> 4. **Question motives.** The best way to get someone annoyed and then have them ignore you is to bypass any thoughtful discussion of facts and instead question what\u2019s in it for the person on the other end. Make assumptions about their motivations and lose their respect.\n\n> 5. **Act anonymously.** What are the chances that heckled comments from the bleachers will have an impact?\n\n> 6. **Threaten to take action in another venue.** Insist that this will come back to haunt the other person. Guarantee you will spread the word or stop purchasing.\n\n> 7. **Bring up the slippery slope.** Actually, the slope isn\u2019t that slippery. People don\u2019t end up marrying dogs, becoming cannibals or harvesting organs because of changes in organization, technology or law.\n\n> 8. **Go to the edges.** This is a variant of the slippery slope, in which you bring up extremes at either end of whatever spectrum is being discussed.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> So, what works?\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> Earn a reputation. Have a conversation. Ask questions. Describe possible outcomes of a point of view. Make connections. Give the other person the benefit of the doubt. Align objectives then describe a better outcome. Show up. Smile.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\nvia [sethgodin.typepad.com](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/11/how-to-lose-an-argument-online.html)",

But how much time are we spending on making our lives better and ensuring a better quality of life for ourselves? How much time are we spending on improving our situations?\n\nvia [sethgodin.typepad.com](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/11/upside-vs-downside.html)\n\n>\n\n> How much of time, staffing and money does your organization spend on creating incredible experiences (vs. avoiding bad outcomes)?\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> At the hospital, it\u2019s probably 5% on the upside (the doctor who puts in the stitches, say) and 95% on the downside (all the avoidance of infection or lawsuits, records to keep, forms to sign). Most of the people you interact with in a hospital aren\u2019t there to help you get what you came for (to get better) they\u2019re there to help you avoid getting worse. At an avant garde art show, on the other hand, perhaps 95% of the effort goes into creating and presenting shocking ideas, with just 5% devoted to keeping the place warm or avoiding falls and spills as you walk in.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> Which is probably as it should be.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> But what about you and your organization? As you get bigger and older, are you busy ensuring that a bad thing won\u2019t happen that might upset your day, or are you aggressively investing in having a remarkable thing happen that will delight or move a customer?\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> A new restaurant might rely on fresh vegetables and whatever they can get at the market. The bigger, more established fast-food chain starts shipping in processed canned food. One is less reliable with bigger upside, the other\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmore dependable with less downside.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> Here\u2019s a rule that\u2019s so inevitable that it\u2019s almost a law: *As an organization grows and succeeds, it sows the seeds of its own demise by getting boring.* With more to lose and more people to lose it, meetings and policies become more about avoiding risk than providing joy.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>",

Which is worse?\n\nCategory: Uncategorized\nDate: November 3, 2009\n\nI think this is a reasonable representation of most Windows users. \u2018Nuff said. Mac Monk, out.\n\nvia [guardian.co.uk](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/sep/28/charlie-brooker-microsoft-mac-windows)\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> ![Windows 7 party](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/9/25/1253897986891/Windows-7-party-001.jpg)\n\n> The most nauseating advert in history? The Windows 7 \u2018launch party\u2019\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> I admit it: I\u2019m a bigot. A hopeless bigot at that: I know my particular prejudice is absurd, but I just can\u2019t control it. It\u2019s [Apple](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apple). I don\u2019t like Apple products. And the better-designed and more ubiquitous they become, the more I dislike them. I blame the customers. Awful people. Awful. Stop showing me your iPhone. Stop stroking your Macbook. Stop telling me to get one.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> Seriously, stop it. I don\u2019t care if Mac stuff is better. I don\u2019t care if Mac stuff is cool. I don\u2019t care if every Mac product comes equipped a magic button on the side that causes it to piddle gold coins and resurrect the dead and make holographic unicorns dance inside your head. I\u2019m not buying one, so shut up and go home. Go back to your house. I know, you\u2019ve got an iHouse. The walls are brushed aluminum. There\u2019s a glowing Apple logo on the roof. And you love it there. You absolute MONSTER.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s safe to assume Mac products are indeed as brilliant as their owners make out. Why else would they spend so much time trying to convert non-believers? They\u2019re not getting paid. They simply want to spread their happiness, like religious crusaders.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> Consequently, nothing pleases them more than watching a PC owner struggle with a slab of non-Mac machinery. It validates their spiritual choice. Recently I sat in a room trying to write something on a Sony Vaio PC laptop which seemed to be running a special slow-motion edition of [Windows](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/windows) Vista specifically designed to infuriate human beings as much as possible. Trying to get it to do anything was like issuing instructions to a depressed employee over a sluggish satellite feed. When I clicked on an application it spent a small eternity contemplating the philosophical implications of opening it, begrudgingly complying with my request several months later. It drove me up the wall. I called it a bastard and worse. At one point I punched a table.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> This drew the attention of two nearby Mac owners. They hovered over and stood beside me, like placid monks.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> \u201cAh: the delights of Vista,\u201d said one.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> \u201cIt really is time you got a Mac,\u201d said the other.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> \u201cThey\u2019re just better,\u201d sang monk number one.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> \u201cYou won\u2019t regret it,\u201d whispered the second.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> I scowled and returned to my infernal machine, like a dishevelled park-bench boozer shrugging away two pious AA recruiters by pulling a grubby, dented hip flask from his pocket and pointedly taking an extra deep swig. Leave me alone, I thought. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re right. I just want you to die.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> I know Windows is awful. Everyone knows Windows is awful. Windows is like the faint smell of piss in a subway: it\u2019s there, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. OK, OK: I know other operating systems are available. But their advocates seem even creepier, snootier and more insistent than Mac owners. The harder they try to convince me, the more I\u2019m repelled. To them, I\u2019m a sheep. And they\u2019re right. I\u2019m a helpless, stupid, lazy sheep. I\u2019m also a masochist. And that\u2019s why I continue to use Windows \u2013 horrible Windows \u2013 even though I hate every second of it. It\u2019s grim, it\u2019s slow, everything\u2019s badly designed and nothing really works properly: using Windows is like living in a communist bloc nation circa 1981. And I wouldn\u2019t change it for the world, because I\u2019m an abject bloody idiot and I hate myself, and this is what I deserve: to be\u00a0sentenced to Windows for life.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> That\u2019s why Windows works for me. But I\u2019d never recommend it to anybody else, ever. This puts me in line with roughly everybody else in the world. No one has ever earnestly turned to a fellow human being and said, \u201cHey, have you considered Windows?\u201d Not in the real world at any rate.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> Until now. [Microsoft](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/microsoft), hellbent on tackling the conspicuous lack of word-of-mouth recommendation, is encouraging people \u2013 real people \u2013 to host \u201cWindows 7 launch parties\u201d to celebrate the 22 October release of, er, Windows 7. The idea is that you invite a group of friends \u2013 your real friends \u2013 to your home \u2013 your real home \u2013 and entertain them with a series of Windows\u00a07 tutorials. So you show them how to burn a CD, how to make a little video, how to change the wallpaper, and how to, oh no, hang on it\u2019s not supposed to do that, oh, I think it\u2019s frozen, um, er, let me just, um, no that\u2019s not it, um, er, um, er, so how\u2019s it going with you and Kathy anyway, um, er, OK well see you around I guess.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> To assist the party-hosting massive, they\u2019ve also uploaded a series of spectacularly cringeworthy videos to YouTube, in which the four most desperate actors in the world stand around in a kitchen sharing tips on how best to indoctrinate guests in the wonder of Windows. If they were staring straight down the lens reading hints off a card it might be acceptable; instead they have been instructed to pretend to be friends. The result is the most nauseating display of artificial camaraderie since the horrific Doritos \u201cFriendchips\u201d TV campaign (which caused 50,000 people to kill themselves in 2003, or should have done).\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> It\u2019s so terrible, it induces an entirely new emotion: a blend of vertigo, disgust, anger and embarrassment which I like to call \u201cshitasmia\u201d. It not only creates this emotion: it defines it. It\u2019s the most shitasmic cultural artefact in history. [Watch it for yourself](http://tinyurl.com/horrorparty \"Windows 7 launch party ad on YouTube\").\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> Still, bad though it is, I vaguely prefer the clumping, clueless, uncool, crappiness of Microsoft\u2019s bland Stepford gang to the creepy assurance of the average Mac evangelist. At least the grinning dildos in the Windows video are fictional, whereas eerie replicant Mac monks really are everywhere, standing over your shoulder in their charcoal pullovers, smirking with amusement at your hopelessly inferior\u00a0OS, knowing they\u2019re better than you because they use Mac OS X v10.6 Snow Leopard.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> Snow Leopard. SNOW LEOPARD*.*\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re right. I just want you to die.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>",

One thing that is most interesting about it, however, is how the site has managed to avoid overcomplicating itself with more features. Twitter is simple, and it just works. Of course the one overused word that has been used recently to describe Twitter is that it is a \u201cfirehose\u201d of information, shooting out at a speed and volume that has threatened to make it unusable for many people. So when I had a chance to try out [Twitter\u2019s new Lists feature](http://blog.twitter.com/2009/09/soon-to-launch-lists.html) (which I had been looking forward to seeing for some time), I was not only surprised, but also excited about what this will mean for all of us who use the site. Here are just a few reasons why I think lists may revolutionize how you use Twitter.\n\nvia [rohitbhargava.typepad.com](http://rohitbhargava.typepad.com/weblog/2009/10/5-ways-to-use-twitters-new-list-feature-for-marketers.html)\n\nFinally an actual use for Twitter Lists.",

Furthermore, even though I love my tunes, I totally know that I couldn\u2019t play my music at a party and get the room pumping.\n\nSo, I am asking the wider community to help me expand my horizons, and hopefully make my birthday party suck less, by letting me know your favourite party song or songs.\n\n**The rules:**\n\n1. You can put 1 or a hundred songs, but please choose songs rather than entire albums.\n\n2. Please choose songs that you like listening to at parties with friends and that get you in a party mood, not just your favourite songs.

                "text": "# DIY: X-Box Controller Mod\n\nCategory: Uncategorized\nDate: February 27, 2009\n\nEver been annoyed at how expensive PC/Mac controllers are, just to find that when compared to console controllers they come up as cheap and inferior? To get around this, simply modify your Classic X-Box controller to work with your PC/Mac.\n\nThis guide provides simple, step-by-step instructions to rewiring your controller that even a beginner can follow. There are two primary aims of this particular tutorial:\n\n1. Mod your controller to work with your PC or Mac\n\n2. Ensure you aren\u2019t throwing money away and the controller will still work with your X-Box\n\n**Note:** Please make sure you follow each step closely. It is important because in some areas there are warnings which if overlooked could completely ruin your day.\n\n* [![Step 1 - Requirements](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/3310624027/in/set-72157614460596558/ \"Step 1 - Requirements\")\n\nHeatshrink, USB Extension cable, X-Box controller, USB Extension cable, Cutting tools, Electrical tape.\n\n* [![Step 2 - Cut](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/3311455574/in/set-72157614460596558/ \"Step 2 - Cut\")\n\nCut both ends of the USB extension cable off about 4\u2033 / 10cm from each end.\n\n* [![Step 3 - Remove cable casing](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/3310625417/in/set-72157614460596558/ \"Step 3 - Remove cable casing\")\n\nRemove the outer rubber casing from the cable by cutting it with your smaller blade. Expose approximately 1/2\u2033 \u2013 1\u2033 (1-2cm approx) from the end.\n\n* [![Step 4 - Remove cable shielding](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/3310624973/in/set-72157614460596558/ \"Step 4 - Remove cable shielding\")\n\nInside the cable will be some highly annoying shielding to protect the cable, some is silver foil and the other is silver wire. Simply discard of all of this.\n\n* [![Step 5 - Remove wire casing](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/3311456722/in/set-72157614460596558/ \"Step 5 - Remove wire casing\")\n\nNow expose a short piece of wire from the end of each of wire. Be careful, some of the wires are quite fine and will break easily.\n\n* [![Step 6 - Discard yellow wire](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/3310626795/in/set-72157614460596558/ \"Step 6 - Discard yellow wire\")\n\nDiscard the yellow wire from the X-Box Controller, it\u2019s only necessary for some of the X-Box light guns.\n\n* [![Step 7 - Pair your cables](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/3311457420/in/set-72157614460596558/ \"Step 7 - Pair your cables\")\n\nPair your cables up. The FEMALE USB matches up with the X-Box end of the cable and the MALE USB matches up with the controller end.\n\n* [![Step 8 - Pair femable USB to X-Box adapter end](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/3310627531/in/set-72157614460596558/ \"Step 8 - Pair femable USB to X-Box adapter end\")\n\nThis is reasonably obvious. The female end of the USB extension cable goes with the X-Box end of the cable. The reason for this is that we want the male end attached to the controller in order to plug it into your PC/Mac.\n\n* [![Step 9 - Cut your heat shrink to length](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/3311459412/in/set-72157614460596558/ \"Step 9 - Cut your heat shrink to length\")\n\nCut off approximately 3\u2033 / 7.5cm of heat shrink, enough to cover all of the exposed wire.\n\n* [![Step 10 - Place your heat shrink](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/3310627967/in/set-72157614460596558/ \"Step 10 - Place your heat shrink\")\n\nPut the heat shrink over the cable BEFORE joining the wires or else you won\u2019t be able to get it on. I made this mistake once and it was highly annoying.\n\n* [![Step 11 - Twist](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/3311458026/in/set-72157614460596558/ \"Step 11 - Twist\")\n\nTwist the wires together at the end. Black to black, red to red, green to green and, amazingly enough, white to white.\n\n* [![Step 12 - Cover twisted pairs with tape](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/3311460328/in/set-72157614460596558/ \"Step 12 - Cover twisted pairs with tape\")\n\nPlace a tiny amount of tape over each of the twisted pairs to ensure that none of the wires can touch each other.\n\n* [![Step 13 - Cover exposed parts with heat shrink](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/3310628893/in/set-72157614460596558/ \"Step 13 - Cover exposed parts with heat shrink\")\n\nPush your heatshrink down so that it is covering the exposed wire. DO NOT bond the heatshrink until you\u2019ve tested the cables are working.\n\n* [![Step 14 - Pair male USB with controller end and repeat](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/3311461196/in/set-72157614460596558/ \"Step 14 - Pair male USB with controller end and repeat\")\n\nThe male end gets attached to the controller in order to be able to be plugged into the PC/Mac. Repeat steps 9 \u2013 13.\n\n* [![Step 15 - Almost-final product for testing](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/3311461930/in/set-72157614460596558/ \"Step 15 - Almost-final product for testing\")\n\nTest your cables. Use the controller with your X-Box/PC/Mac in order to confirm everything is right. On OSX use [Xbox HID Driver for Mac OS X](http://www.redcl0ud.com/xbcd.html).\n\n* [![Step 16 - Final product](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/3311462556/in/set-72157614460596558/ \"Step 16 - Final product\")\n\nFinally, blast the heatshrink with a hairdryer or use a cigarette lighter to bond the heatshrink with the exposed pieces. Suddenly you have the final product ready to go.\n\nWhat you should be left with now is a controller that can work with any and all of your devices. This will save you money on shelling out for expensive PC/Mac controllers, giving you a much better quality gaming experience.\n\nI have tried this controller extensively with several Mac games, several emulators on Mac and various other cool stuff and have had no issues at all.\n\n**Disclaimer** If you break anything along the way, it is so totally *not* my fault. I am really sorry if the instructions weren\u2019t simple enough, but I am pretty confident they are and no one should run into any issues.",

Over the years I have tried a gamut of different RSS readers, both online and offline, and I have also subscribed to many, many blogs most of which I no longer read for one reason or another.\n\nSo when I come across a blog that seems particularly inspired and has some content worth sharing, I am going to take the time to make recommendations. Recently, I\u2019ve started reading a very strong blog called TechMiso, a blog that I believe I really should share. Like any technology blog there is an amount of it that I skim over, but the articles I find interesting to my own technology interests are well written, informed and most importantly, interesting.\n\n[TechMiso](http://jark.deviantart.com/) and have looked up to as a writer and blogger for quite some time.\n\nWhile the blog is in it\u2019s infancy, so far I have read quite a few interesting articles specifically focusing on technology issues that matter today. If you\u2019re looking for another blog to add to your Google Reader account, this is one to watch and I would recommend checking it out!",

In my opinion there is one large component that is being missed by browsers today and it should be reasonable easy to develop. What I\u2019m talking about is cross-platform, cloud-based integration. I\u2019ll explain as I go.\n\nFirstly let me make my point by explaining my current browser setup. At home I run a Mac and at work I use a PC. On both I have Firefox as my browser of choice, but due to the necessity of my work CRM I also use Internet Explorer 6/7 on both. I use several plugins to try and sync as best I can between the computers, but inevitably it\u2019s all just a fix. Okay, so now I will try and make my point.\n\nGoogle released [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) today which has some interesting features. Tighter integration to applications is great, but is it enough to win the browser war? Better security is always a good thing, but in a market where most computer users don\u2019t even know which anti-virus they\u2019re running, does it really matter? In fact, most of the features are aimed at techies and not the people who actually need enhanced functionality from an out-of-the-box browser.\n\nImagine a browser that worked like this\u2026 You launch the application and you\u2019re greeted with a login screen. You enter a username and password and the browser works it\u2019s magic; it downloads your bookmarks, it loads your plugins, it downloads your saved passwords, it downloads your form information, and it also loads your history.\n\nNow imagine the same thing can happen on any computer you\u2019re using, with the same features and plugins, even if you\u2019ve never used that computer before. Simple huh? How easy would your life be, honestly?\n\nSo many plugins have tried to make this happen, but it\u2019s never truly been seamless and it\u2019s never been 100%, especially when it turns to cross-platform. This would be, as Tolkien would say, \u201cOne Browser to rule them all, One Browser to bind them!\u201d Think about it.",

One of the really interesting parts of this discussion was the fact that I was constantly able to speak of the technical aspects and our MD would always bring that back to business realities.\n\nDuring the meeting we watched an amazing video called [Shift Happens](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMcfrLYDm2U) which raised a lot of interesting points about globalisation. The video is very US-centric, but realising the implications on Australia is honestly quite eye opening.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen these videos already, I strongly suggest watching them. If you\u2019re in a business that is potentially effected by the statements, I even more strongly recommend considering what this means to you and how this will effect your life. Because it *will* effect your life.\n\nIn a world of outsourcing, our lives change daily and the effects of growing economies such as India and China are effecting our lives all the time.\n\nAsk yourself\u2026\n\n* Can I be replaced by someone overseas?\n\n* Am I costing my company money, or making my company money?\n\n* Are there necessarily advantages of having me sit in my seat in Sydney?",

Although Starbucks are closing in Australia now so I anticipate a downturn in Apple product sales.\n\n3. **Listening to Powderfinger** \u2013 I once bought two album\u2019s titled \u201cParables for Wooden Ears\u201d and \u201cDouble Allergic\u201d and got called weird by all my friends. Fast-forward to their 1st major release \u201cInternationalist\u201d and everyone is listening.\n\n4. **Google** \u2013 I used to use Google on a daily basis before Gmail, calendars, online shopping, videos and everything else. In fact, I used to use it when it was only a search engine and only had two buttons on the interface.\n\n5. **Burning CD\u2019s** \u2013 I started burning CD\u2019s around the time most people I knew were buying CD players. I remember blanks cost around $10 each and I remember hearing things like \u201cCD media won\u2019t ever last, why did you buy a CD burner?\u201d\n\n6. **Blogging** \u2013 before there were blogging engines, there was notepad. When I was 15 (quite some time ago, as I\u2019ve mentioned) I ran a website which I updated almost daily, manually updating\n\n7. **Hating Big Brother** \u2013 Just the other day I hear my media queen mother spout \u201cBig Brother has lost it\u2019s appeal.\u201d Newsflash: it never had any. To all the people saddened by the fact it\u2019s the last year: cry me a river, losers!\n\n8. **Mobile Browsing** \u2013 I began browsing the web back in the days of monochrome dot-matrix on my [Nokia 7110](http://www.nokia-asia.com/A4416714). It sure sucked hard, but try and beat that for keen!\n\nPlus there are also a few things I do now that I hope will be cool one day (i.e. watching Star Trek, wokring 60 hour weeks and using stupid phrases like \u201ccrap ya later!\u201d)",

I\u2019ve done design, digital photography, web development, systems administration, studied a computer science degree, and I am an all-round technophile.\n\nOne thing I never got involved in, and for some reason never wanted to, was animation. The idea of it just made me feel anxious and the fiddly nature just always turned me off. That is, until this week.\n\nFor almost the entire weekend I spent all of my time locked in a [UTS](http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects/) after the experience.\n\nI am currently in the process of building Claire\u2019s online showreel and it could very well feature some animation work done by the two of us, which I will happily post a link to it here after it\u2019s up.

The photo-a-day experiment will be a flickr.com photoset, a tumblr blog and a weekly digest posted to *bananas on toast* (to save clutter).\n\nThere will be photos of me, coffee cups, the occasional small person and some kielbasa sausage.

For me, I don\u2019t wake up and dread heading into work (most days anyway), in fact most days the idea of hitting the offices excites me a little.\n\nI love my job, my career path, my company and my colleagues. But when things get scary and stressful, leaving all that stuff in the office can be difficult, especially when things go wrong.\n\nTo quote my hero, [Ari Gold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari_Gold_(Entourage)):\n\n> **Eric Murphy:**  Ari, I\u2019m getting killed here. Vince isn\u2019t happy.\n\n>\n\n> **Ari Gold:**  Of course he\u2019s not happy. Nobody\u2019s happy in this town except for the losers. Look at me, I\u2019m miserable\u2026 that\u2019s why I\u2019m rich.\n\n>\n\n>\n\nNow I\u2019m not rich\u2026 not yet anyway\u2026 but I *am* successful. And I do know that a certain level of stress, or let\u2019s call it urgency, is totally necessary to be good at what you do. Especially if you love your work and care about the job that you do.\n\nSo right now, after working 11.5 hours, I am going to leave Work Mitch at work and go have a beer with my best mate Matt. And I am going to enjoy it and relax.\n\nOver and out.",

Feel free to use this, but do credit me. I hereby license this MSN gag under a [Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 2.5 Australia License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/au/). Done, my gag, I own it. Boom!\n\n**Step 1: The Setup**\n\nStart by some casual chat using the \u2588 character to block out some bad language.\n\n**You:** Hey dude, what\u2019s up?\n\n**John Do:** Not a lot, just at work.\n\n**You:** Yeah same, what a \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 huh? I really just can\u2019t be \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588ed today.\n\n**Step 2: Act Dumb**\n\nBy now you\u2019ve got them curious and they\u2019re asking questions about why all the language is being censored out.\n\n**John Do:** Uh dude, why is it censoring all the bad language?\n\n**You:** What do you mean?\n\n**John Do:** I keep seeing black boxes where swear words should be?\n\n**You:** What the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 are you on about?\n\n**John Do:** See what I mean?\n\n**You:** No I don\u2019t, what the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 are you on about? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 you\u2019re being weird!\n\n**John Do:** I swear to god, you\u2019re being censored!\n\n**You:** \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, really? That\u2019s \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588ing weird!\n\n**Step 3: Drop the V-Bomb**\n\nYou\u2019re presumably tech-savvy and smarter than your friend so introduce some virus chat to really get them a bit worked up.\n\n**You:** Oh god, I\u2019ve heard about this virus. Apparently it blocks all your swearing and forwards itself through MSN. I can see the swear words here, but you\u2019re sure you can\u2019t see them there? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588ity \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2013 can you see that?\n\n**John Do:** No, I can\u2019t, it\u2019s censored.\n\n**You:** I hope I haven\u2019t given the virus to you, you try swearing.\n\n**John Do:** Shit \u2013 can you see that?\n\n**You:** No! All I see is black! Oh I\u2019m so sorry for giving you virus!\n\n***Note:** just copy and paste the black squares, it\u2019s easier.*\n\n\u2018Nuff said. Go forth and wreak havoc.",

                "text": "# Catching the eye of a recruiter\n\nCategory: Work\nDate: April 29, 2008\n\nInteresting article on KRIS.TV today titled [\u201cCatching the Eye of an Executive Recruiter\u201d](http://www.kristv.com/Global/story.asp?S=6248164&nav=menu192_11_8). It makes some obvious points, some less-obvious points and misses one key area to finding the attention of a recruiter.\n\nOne of the points it raises is that recruiters are only interested in the roles they are working on. This absolutely should not be the case with a good recruiter and finding good talent should always be a priority for this kind of individual.\n\nThis raises the most important point missed in the article: find *good* or even *great* recruiters who are inside your network.\n\nWith so many recruitment agencies who barely know what they are doing, make sure you find a recruiter you can genuinely partner with. Find a recruiter who your colleagues and friends deal with a lot, who comes highly recommended and meet with them. Make your recruiter your friend.\n\nIn a mutually beneficial recruitment partnership the candidate owes as much to the recruiter as the recruiter owes to the candidate. Offering your consultant a degree of exclusivity, prompt feedback and regular updates are an excellent start to making yourself a priority to your recruitment consultant. Offering them referrals is an even better way to stay front of mind \u2013 good people should always know other good people.\n\nThis brings me to my last point: know where your CV is. Your CV is a personal document and a window to your professional career; not knowing who has it is a fatal mistake made by a vast majority of candidates. Nothing will ruin your name in the recruitment marketplace like dozens of consultants fighting over representation rights or clients seeing your CV from multiple agencies. Long story short: don\u2019t be a CV whore.",

Home fridge: beer, sports drinks and toasties. Work fridge: almost everything *except* the beer (until Friday that is).\n\n2. **E-mail** \u2013 you are so bad at checking your personal e-mail that your friends actually have to call and ask if you got their letter. Meanwhile, you have a blackberry and web portals to check your work e-mail from anywhere.\n\n3. **Sundays** \u2013 they\u2019re kind of like Mondays and you\u2019ve completely given up on having them, why not get just a few hours in the office before you get another 60+ hours of work in.\n\n4. **Sleep** \u2013 almost completely optional and never allowed to get in the road of getting in to work an hour or two earlier than you should be. Nothing feels better than hitting the office before everyone else.\n\n5. **Colleagues vs Friends** \u2013 suddenly you notice you have plenty of friends, but 400% more colleagues, ex-colleagues and business partners. But you don\u2019t care, friends don\u2019t make you money.\n\n6. **Networking** \u2013 you can\u2019t even walk the dog without giving your business card to someone or thinking about who you should be speaking to.\n\n7. **Clothes** \u2013 you don\u2019t have a single t-shirt at home to wear to the bar, but you have 6 suits and 20+ shirts all pressed in the work closet.\n\n8. **Sunlight** \u2013 you leave so early for work you only catch first glimpses, you leave so late that it\u2019s beyond dusk. You pretty much have no idea what sunlight is and your Vitamin D comes from artificial sources.\n\n9. **Caffeine** \u2013 your blood/caffeine levels have been replaced with caffeine blood levels. It\u2019s no longer a pick me up, it\u2019s now your sole lifesource.\n\n10. **Relationships** \u2013 yes, finally the big one. You know loads of people, but maintain contact through Facebook and MSN. You send more cybercoffees and buy more virtual gifts than real ones and your idea of a date is lifting back the lid on your girlfriend/boyfriends microwave meal.\n\nIf you relate to more than just a few of these, your life is potentially as sad as mine.\n\n**Note:** It has been bought to my attention by my lovely girlfriend Claire that this might seem to paint a picture that perhaps I am a boring bastard who never pays for a meal. Just on the record, I definitely make time in my week to make sure she is adequately spoiled. :-)",

                "text": "# Getting an apartment in Sydney\n\nCategory: Uncategorized\nDate: April 23, 2008\n\nFinding your apartment in Sydney (and probably other places) in today\u2019s rental market is a nightmare. People are literally lining up for property viewings, applying by the dozens, and in a lot of instances doing literally whatever it takes to get properties.\n\nI viewed a property on Saturday with two friends, applied on Saturday and had the property secured by Tuesday. The reasons I was able to secure the property so quickly are two fold. And both of the attributes you have complete control over.\n\nThe two things that are absolutely vital to a good and quick rental application are a solid rental history and an excellent application. The rental history should already be taken care of if you\u2019re a good tenant, but I will share some tips for an excellent application that were given to me by a 20-year veteran property manager.\n\n1. **Be prepared** \u2013 download applications from the real estate agents website or go to their premises and retrieve them, and have them filled out well before you even go to the property. Don\u2019t be sitting outside trying to think of referees or rental histories, it\u2019s not going to work.\n\n2. **Be *really* prepared** \u2013 have *everything* ready; your bond, your first month of rent and photo copies of relevant paperwork (drivers license, birth certificate, etc. etc.)\n\n3. **Cover letter** \u2013 they\u2019re not just for job hunting; write the property manager a letter telling him about yourself and your situation. In our case there were 3 guys applying and we wrote a letter to make it very clear that we weren\u2019t looking for a \u201cparty house\u201d and that we are three professional guys.\n\n4. **Introduce yourself** \u2013 the property manager is potentially showing the house to dozens and dozens of potential tenants \u2013 in our case it was apparently over 200 people. Introduce yourself, hand in your application and cover letter while you\u2019re there. This makes you front of mind right from the start.\n\n5. **Follow up** \u2013 don\u2019t hand in an application and forget about it. Call the property manage and ask how the applications are going, ask if he needs any more information and remind him that you have all the relevant documents and the money ready to go. E-mails are a great follow up too as it prompts a response always\n\n6. **Hedge your bets** \u2013 you\u2019ve maximised your chances of getting *the* property, now maximise your chances of getting *any* property that you\u2019re interested in. You will like more than one property, so apply to more than one property. It\u2019s like cheating; it\u2019s okay if she\u2019s doing it, right?\n\n7. **Be polite** \u2013 common sense, but I\u2019ve heard of guys getting really upset over the property, this just won\u2019t do anyone any favours.\n\n8. **Have support** \u2013 make sure all your references are prepared and your housemates (if any) are ready to go. Also, it helps if you\u2019re a little younger your parents are on your side (thanks mum)!\n\nI hope this helps anyone looking for a property and explains perhaps where you\u2019ve been going wrong in your applications. It\u2019s a tough market and you have to treat every application very seriously and maximise your chances of finding that dream apartment.",

                "text": "# The Things You Own, Own You\n\nCategory: Geek\nDate: April 7, 2008\n\nThis morning while perusing some news items I came across [an interesting article](http://blogs.smh.com.au/mashup/archives/random_access/017820.html \"SHM: Handset Rage\") on SMH about people who spend money on gadgets they can\u2019t necessarily afford, don\u2019t need the features and certainly don\u2019t have the computer savvy mind to \u201cdrive\u201d these devices.\n\nAs a gadget geek I scoffed at the implication that people are so silly that they buy devices they don\u2019t use, but then suddenly found myself looking inwards to think about how I use my technology and just how much value it all adds to my life.\n\nThe first thing that comes to my phone. Every time I bring it out of my pocket geeks, and non-geeks alike, look in wonderment and start asking me about the features. When I tell them about the 5MP camera and GPS they are so impressed that they begin to talk about wanting one. But do I even use it?\n\nTo go through my rather extremely extensive geek collection and lay out how much I use, this might take a while but will paint a pretty accurate picture of what I need and don\u2019t need.\n\nHold on to your hats.\n\n**Nokia N95**\n\n**GPS** \u2013 3 times in 6 months\n\n**Camera** \u2013 often more than once a day\n\n**Web** \u2013 several times a day\n\n**SMS** \u2013 several times a day\n\n**Calling** \u2013 almost all day constantly \u2013 it\u2019s my job\n\n**Work Blackberry** (new, but this is assumptive)\n\n**E-mail** \u2013 all day\n\n**Phone** \u2013 all day, it will take over from my N95 for work calls\n\n**Web** \u2013 several times a day\n\n**Calender / extra feature** \u2013 all day\n\n**MacBook**\n\n**All features** \u2013 for a few hours a day or every other day\n\n**iPod 60GB**\n\n**Music** \u2013 every morning and afternoon after work\n\n**Video** \u2013 once a week or maybe less\n\n**iPod Nano 4GB**\n\n**Music** \u2013 several times a week jogging, ideally, but actually not as often as I should\n\n**Video** \u2013 never\n\n**Canon 350D D-Rebel**\n\n**Photos (d\u2019uh)** \u2013 once a week but maybe less\n\n**PSP (Playstation Portable)**\n\n**Games** \u2013 less than a few times a month\n\n**Internet** \u2013 Not often, but I should use more such as RSS on the bus\n\n**Other features** \u2013 Never\n\n**X-Box**\n\nHaven\u2019t touched it in years\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n**Printer** \u2013 not in years\n\n**Photo printer** \u2013 even longer\n\n**Desktop PC** \u2013 over a year\n\n**Television** \u2013 in storage for over a year\n\n**iPod Shuffle** \u2013 over a year\n\n**Palm T|X** \u2013 over a year since I smashed the screen, but didn\u2019t use enough at all\n\n*Plus god knows how much else that I can\u2019t even think of\u2026*\n\nHow much of this stuff just belongs on eBay? Maybe just making some streamlining to my life to use fewer gadgets and use them more often? There is just too much junk here and considering most of it is portable, I have none of it with me (barring my phone of course) on a day-to-day basis.\n\nWhat is your experience of buying technologies you don\u2019t use? How many hundreds, or even thousands, of dollars worth of electo-crap do you have lying around your house?",

I\u2019m talking about the kind of \u201cback\u201d where I probably don\u2019t mean it and I\u2019ll be gone again in a few days.\n\nRegardless, I\u2019m blogging. And if you\u2019re one of the many 2 people who have asked me when I\u2019m going to start writing again, then the answer is now. Now!\n\nAlright, so this is the last Mitch post. You might notice that all the old posts are back, which I didn\u2019t think they would ever be, but moreso that the design has changed for a rather final step. This design, for better or worse, will be the design I continue to use for some time. There will be minor 1.1.x updates, but this is all.\n\nSo what am I going to write about? It\u2019ll still be a little about me, but I am going to try and give the blog some aim and some direction. I update Twitter several times a day with the boring shit I get up to, and I have facebook for boring banter, I want to give the site some direction.\n\nSo, this is what will (hopefully) happen over the next few weeks. I will delete quite a few old posts that are just crap. I will tag the posts that are here now and get the blog acting a little more 2.0 (\u2018cuz I\u2019m 1337). And I will hopefully start blogging about things with a little more substance\n\nOh, and I\u2019m going to delete all, and I mean ALL, the posts that mention that I am going to start writing again. Including this one if I don\u2019t hold my word and don\u2019t start writing more often.\n\nSo peace out, comment like a madman, and stay cool.",

                "text": "# Hallowed Internet, digital be thy name\u2026 make me famous!\n\nCategory: Rant\nDate: December 12, 2007\n\nOver time people have become famous for a lot of different things. [Stella Liebeck](http://www.stellaawards.com/), based on the ridiculous lawsuit she took out against the McDonald\u2019s giant.\n\nBut these days with the [internet](http://www.filmfodder.com/movies/reviews/jay_and_silent_bob/images/jay_and_silent_bob.jpg) anyone can be famous, even if it\u2019s just for a day. There are an almost limitless number of ways you can make yourself famous on the internet. Majority of those ways involve making a loser out of yourself on YouTube, or getting in trouble over some poorly thought out MySpace photos, but it\u2019s all fame nonetheless.\n\n[Wil Wheaton](http://www.youtube.com/parishilton \"Go away, we're sick of you!\") managed some time in the light when her sex video \u201caccidently\u201d found it\u2019s way onto video and file sharing networks.\n\nAnd off the internet I have even less time for Big Brother throw-back, [Ryan \u201cFitzy\u201d Fitzgerald](http://www.katedearaugo.com.au/).\n\nI could literally go on forever over the shitty ways people have become famous, but what makes my mind boggle is how [Chris](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHmvkRoEowc&eurl)\n\n\u201cLike\u2026 Double-Ya Tee Eff, mate?\u201d\n\nTo be perfectly honest, as much as I\u2019ve loved all the internet bagging of this complete joke, even that is a little too much attention for this absolute drama queen effort.\n\nPersonaly I would like to see [the fat kid who sang Numa Numa](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFcZ9IqqhlQ) make it big as the next poster child for Subway. I am thinking that MTV spends loads of money to get him thin, put\u2019s him in Britney\u2019s dancing crew to make her shitty efforts of entertainment seem slightly less dull by comparison, and follows him across the country as they terrorise children and crash cars.\n\nIn fact, here is my list of 5 internet \u201calmosts\u201d who should be made famous before Chris Crocker even gets a look-in:\n\n* [Ask a Ninja](http://askaninja.com/) \u2013 just funny, perhaps he could do commercial appearances?\n\n* [Star Wars Kid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPPj6viIBmU) \u2013 heavily ridiculed after his internet embarrassment, give the kid a break and perhaps a Wilson golf club endoursment.\n\n* [Justin](http://ijustine.com/). Give the guy a break, he invented that little wheel!\n\n* Anyone who blogs regularly about blogging.\n\n* Anyone with a pulse and an internet presence.\n\nI mean, seriously, is there *no one else* we can give a little leg-up to except the internet Freak of the Month September, 2007? Is the talent pool of America, and the greater world for that matter, really so low that we have to resort to such desperate measures as making this token-loser some kind of \u201cnew kid on the block\u201d at MTV?\n\nApparently everyone gets 15 minutes of fame, but surely this Queer Eye reject has already had his. I hope I get mine by doing something really cool, however I know that I will probably get my name on the board for a few lousy moments for growing a large turnip or a bizarre incident involving a midget. But I can tell you what it won\u2019t involve: me, ponsing about on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/), crying for a has-been superstar, and making an absolute twat of myself.",

In fact, if you ever read here, you should definitely remember it because it caused a hell of a ruck.\n\nAnyway, after not having heard much from James Blunt in a little while except for a murmur of an album, I looked at my favourite news site this morning and noticed that \u201csongs from James Blunt\u2019s 2005 debut album *Back to Bedlam* are the most popular at weddings and funerals.\u201d\n\nWow, I totally eat my words about any horrible thing I\u2019ve ever said about James.

                "text": "# deviantFART\n\nCategory: Rant\nDate: September 17, 2007\n\nOkay, firstly I am well aware that the deviantART administration will, most likely out of spite, take away my membership as a senior member of their website, but this must be said.\n\nIt was a long time ago that I first noticed deviantART on the interweb. In fact, as of writing this post, it was 3 Years and 154 Days ago. At the time I was doing freelance design work and wanted a space that I could post some of my photography.\n\nNow let\u2019s make one thing clear, I pretty much suck as bad as anyone on that site, but don\u2019t shoot me. The thing that kept me around wasn\u2019t the warm comments from every user on the site and it wasn\u2019t the fact that was popular, it was because it was just an easy way to do something I wanted to do.\n\nLater I became an administration on dAmn, then latest still I had to leave the administration because I didn\u2019t have enough time to give to what they were doing. No hard feelings, it\u2019s just something that happens.\n\nLast night I wanted to upload some photos to their website that I had taken recently. Now, these weren\u2019t any better than the crap I\u2019ve always uploaded, but I was proud of these photos and wanted them displayed.\n\nNothing could have prepared me for the ass-ache of uploading these photos.\n\nAt a guess I would say that it took me 5 minutes to work out the process. I consider myself *very geeky tech-savvy and I can\u2019t remember the last time it took me 5 minutes to do* *anything* on a computer.\n\nClearly, the term \u201cusability\u201d has completely escaped the guys at deviantART.\n\nThen, the mother of all, the absolute crowning glory, the mother of all\u2026 [adCast](http://my.deviantart.com/services/#adcast)\n\nWhen I was a regular member and user it was not uncommon for people to abuse the site, spam the hell out of it just to get clicks to their page. But now for just a few dollars, you can get 500 pageviews. That\u2019s right kids, don\u2019t spam, just pay. We here at deviantART know how hard it is to fit in and be cooler than the other deviantART members, now just steal a credit card.\n\nOkay, so I am sure the administrators/owners/site-thiefs don\u2019t really want to see kids stealing, but I have never been more appalled by how commercial deviantART has become until tonight.\n\nI am sure \u00b0[jark](http://jark.deviantart.com/) can barely believe what he sees when he goes to a site he poured his absolute heart into for such a long time.\n\nMitch. Disgusted. Over and out.",

It was seriously a great week and turning 25 wasn\u2019t half as scary as I thought it might be, but it\u2019s all due to the care and consideration of my wonderful girlfriend, Claire.\n\nOn Friday night of last week I asked Claire a very important question; I asked her if she would take our relationship to the next level. The question that I asked her was if she would be my internet girlfriend as well as my real-life girlfriend. That\u2019s right, we\u2019re now cyber-dating as well. The *next* step.\n\nNow, this may sound weird, but my blog and various other geek haunts I frequent, have long been considered \u201cMitch\u2019s Domain\u201d. Claire had always considered posting comments to my blog, or replying to my Twitters, to be something that was just a bit out of reach for us and something she wasn\u2019t comfortable with.\n\nSo during my birthday week, Sunday was possibly the best day. We got [Claire\u2019s blog](http://www.19hundred.com/) and be sure to [say hi if you\u2019re a twitter member]( http://twitter.com/clarisphillie/).",

                "text": "# Employers Choice to Ban\n\nCategory: Rant\nDate: September 5, 2007\n\nBefore I begin I would like to make the following statement: I completely support the employers to choose which websites and activities are banned within the work place and I believe that as an employee of said workplace, you should adhere to these guidelines. This being said, the rules don\u2019t apply to me, so leave me alone while I have a little rant.\n\nMy colleague who sits opposite me fields calls from his on-again off-again girlfriend several times a day, is nagged by her for a whole bunch of unimportant stuff, hangs up and complains to me. This equates to, approximately, an hour to an hour and a half of his day, every day. Not only this, but the same colleague has several lunch\u2019s, spends significant time singing to himself and generally being unproductive.\n\nAnother colleague of mine is a heavy caffeine addict. She makes several cups a day, coupled this with numerous visits to Starbucks, plus the additional time spent at the thermos collecting hot water and chatting. She also has a boyfriend who likes to phone a few times a day. I know this, because when *I* get coffee she is always there and tells me so.\n\nI raise these two points not as issues, but I think they illustrate that there are only so many hours that an employee can be productive. I think if you spend 10 \u2013 12 hours a day in your office space working, there come periods in your day that to maintain your productivity, and sanity, you just need a break.\n\nUntil three weeks ago I would occasionally log on to [Facebook](http://www.meebo.com/) once or twice a day to arrange my evening with my girlfriend/friends and/or catch up with a few friends from back hom.\n\nNow thanks to my good friends down at [MimeSweeper](http://www.clearswift.com/products/email.aspx) I no longer have either. You see, as a business decision my company has decided to block these websites due to the fact that it\u2019s a time wasting sites and it promotes a lack of productivity.\n\nI tend to think the fact that during my 10 \u2013 12 hours a day, the fact my mind wanders for an hour a day is pretty insignificant, especially since I don\u2019t even break for lunch. Is it impossible to fathom that these websites are a pretty minor distraction in the work place and that letting staff send the occasional message to plan their weekend/evening, rather then letting them worry about it, could actually be more productive?\n\nConsider it.",

Let me try and paint a picture of a modern-day, net connected, 20-something suburban geek.\n\nWhen I am browsing the net and I see an interesting link, I post it to [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/bananasontoast/).\n\nWhen I am doing something noteworth, I take a photo on my k800i, and use [Shozu to send it to](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/).\n\nWhen I think something profound, I write it here at [bananas on toast](http://uat.bananasontoast.org/).\n\nWhen I am doing something even slightly of interest, I [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/bananasontoast/) it.\n\nI have a splash page, [MMdN: Mitch Malone dot NAME](http://www.mitchmalone.name/), full of links to me and about me.\n\nI even use [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) from time to time to stalk the wonderful Claire.\n\nI have an account I haven\u2019t used in a little while at [deviantArt](http://www.deviantart.com/) and I am a member at around 25-50 forums that I never frequent more than once a year.\n\nI have accounts I have never really used at [iStalkr](http://yumondo.com/).\n\nSo how does one keep track of it all? Wouldn\u2019t it be fantastic if there was just some way of knowing where all these accounts were, what they were doing and what was happening with them all. And isn\u2019t there a better way to write a site bio than trying to be witty in a million different sites?\n\nIt\u2019s just too much people! Bring on the [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/), I don\u2019t ever want to be un-connected!",

I love gadgets, computers, software, websites, Mac-good, iPods and everything that goes with. So when Apple declared that Australia, as per usual of US companies, would have to wait a whole year until we see the iPhone I was naturally disappointed.\n\nYesterday while browsing I found an interesting website of a guy who managed to [hack the iPhone](http://iphonejtag.blogspot.com/). Pretty impressive stuff with some over complicated instructions, but I still think this is pretty incredible.\n\nI\u2019ve previously seen a [couple]( http://www.hackint0sh.org/forum/showthread.php?t=2215&page=1) of interesting fixes also on hackint0sh.com that look a lot less risky, perhaps I will try one of these at some point.\n\nSo, for the next question; will I be buying one at some point?

My alarm rings familiarly in my ear and Claire thumbs at my phone to turn it off. It\u2019s taking her ages and the alarm rings louder and louder, agitating us both. Eventually the alarm is off and thus begins the next part of day one.\n\nIn the car and we\u2019re driving along. Claire and I are being driven 3, hours to catch a 3 hour train, to catch a 3 hour plane. It\u2019s 8:00am, I am in the car with my brother, his girlfriend, my mother, her dog (yes, believe it) and Claire. Why half of my family had to come I do not know, probably to add to the drama of this trip.\n\nThe next point of interest is the shitty McDonald\u2019s service. 20 minutes to get some McMuffin\u2019s and some coffee and to almost lose my patience at the daft 16 year old standing behind the espresso machine. We\u2019re back on the road and by my calculations we\u2019re going to make it with about 4 minutes to spare. If we\u2019re lucky. I rarely am.\n\n47 kilometers to go, every single person in the car except Claire and I needs to go to the bathroom and the car needs fuel. We\u2019re stopped, fueling up, going to the bathroom and by my calculations we can no longer make it on time. We\u2019re late, there is no catching up and our holiday is ruined.\n\nLike hell.\n\nI get behind the wheel and we cruise at maximum optimum speed and make it with about 2 minutes to spare. I\u2019ve been stressing so much I feel sick to my stomach and I am dry heaving. I cannot believe we\u2019ve made it. Claire and I spend a few minutes catching our breath and hugging and then spend the rest of the time watching Family Guy on my Mac.\n\nNot much worth mentioning until we get to New Zealand and going through customs. I walk to the counter for Customs and hand over my passport, visitor slip and ticket. The lady looks at them for perhaps 0.4 seconds, punches a few keys and throws it to me. I walk a few steps and hear the guy taking Claire\u2019s passport barely.\n\nGuy: \u201cWhat do you do for a living?\u201d (As if it\u2019s not on the card she gave him)\n\nClaire: \u201cUhm, a student!\u201d\n\nGuy: \u201cCool\u2026 What are you studying?\u201d\n\nClaire: \u201cArts\u2026?\u201d\n\nGuy: \u201cCool\u2026 Here on business or pleasure?\u201d\n\nI come to the sudden realisation that the customs dude is hitting on my girlfriend. Blatantly. And I couldn\u2019t even make the old, rather unattractive lady who took my passport even look at me. It suddenly becomes abundantly clear who \u2018has it\u2019 and who doesn\u2019t. I concede defeat and accept my trophy and take Claire\u2019s hand. He might have a fancy customs counter, but I have Claire. Great success!\n\nClaire and I wander from the airport and jump in a cab. Turns out that the taxi driver has a daughter living in Australia and loves the country. He gives us a few tips on being in New Zealand, drops us at our (cheap) accomodation and we drop our bags off.\n\nHoly crap, Christchurch is just beautiful. The city is amazing and Claire and I spend about an hour wandering the streets and admiring. It\u2019s the middle of the night, the streets are empty and it qualifies as possibly the most romantic setting ever. We wander, talk like we haven\u2019t talked in weeks, wander home and fall asleep in each others arms.",

So imagine my surprise when I log in and read an article on an amazing young African boy, William Kamkwamba.\n\nWilliam Kamkwamba is a 19 year old African high school student who built a windmill for his village:\n\n> \u201cThe windmill is remarkable because Kamkwamba left school at 14 as his family was unable to pay the school fees. Armed only with his intelligence, a book on electricity, some plastic piping and found objects, Kamkwamba built his first windmill, which generated enough power to run a light in his room.\u201d\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> \u201cHis second, larger windmill uses a bicycle to increase efficiency and was able to generate power for his parents\u2019 house and charge car batteries or mobile phones for people in his village.\u201d\n\n>\n\n>\n\nNot only did this amazing young man discover the ability to generate electricity for his village, but he also discovered the internet. His blog is called [William Kamkwamba\u2019s Malawi Windmill Blog]( http://www.williamkamkwamba.typepad.com/) and concentrates on his efforts to improve his windmill and improve the quality of life of his village. He also has a [flickr account]( http://www.flickr.com/photos/9278648@N04/) and an e-mail address, pretty impressive stuff for a person who didn\u2019t know the internet existed only a few weeks ago.\n\nI urge anyone who is as inspired as me by this story to make a donation via the blog.",

Today when I logged on these were the top articles:\n\n* **[Man charged over murder plot](http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/man-charged-over-murder-plot/2007/05/30/1180205296554.html)**\n\n* **[Armed drug addict on the run](http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/armed-drug-addict-on-the-run/2007/05/30/1180205284558.html)**\n\n* **[Man ate corgi on air in royal protest](http://www.smh.com.au/news/unusual-tales/man-ate-corgi-on-air-in-royal-protest/2007/05/30/1180205292481.html)**\n\n* **[Woman charged with stabbing murder](http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/woman-charged-with-stabbing-murder/2007/05/30/1180205279547.html)**\n\n* **[Girl, 12, goes missing](http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/girl-12-goes-missing/2007/05/30/1180205284561.html)**\n\n* **[Mother hangs four daughters, baby survives](http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/mother-hangs-four-daughters-baby-survives/2007/05/30/1180205279775.html)**\n\nApart from the article about the guy eating the Corgi, which is mildly humorous in a really sick way, this isn\u2019t exactly loaded with good news.

                "text": "# The many faces of Mitch\n\nCategory: Personal Blog\nDate: May 20, 2007\n\nLately I have noticed that in my life I have so many different faces, personas and so many different people who are in my life. I have my professional life, my private life, and the life that really only gets shared with Claire. I do my hair differently depending on what day it is and who I will be seeing, I dress so differently at different times it\u2019s almost confusing even me, and it\u2019s almost hard to keep up with.\n\n**Corporate vs. Casual**\n\nWandering the offices it\u2019s all clean-cut. Seeing me dressed in a Ted Baker suit, a Hugo Boss shirt and tie, and excellent cufflinks given to me by Claire is really not that uncommon. I rarely let slip even the smallest profanity, I keep rather quiet and work my ass off. I put everything I have into my work.\n\nWeekends and commute to work, however, is a very different story. Comfortable jeans, studded leather belt, pinstripe hooded sweater, converse all-stars and a beanie. Crumpler bag over my should with badges appended to it, loaded with my geeky gadgets and things I might need. It\u2019s a very different look compares to when I am at work.\n\n**Country vs. City**\n\nAlthough I grew up in the country, I have never considered myself a country person until I lived in the city. While I am definitely a city person with what I like, do and how I act most of the time, I still feel the country boy coming out of me.\n\nMost days I am in such a rush with so much on my mind that I am just like any other city person, but I feel like I am so much more polite than the city people I see around. I still thank every shopkeeper I come across, I still let people enter and exit before me, I still say hello to people out of instinct and I still find myself far more patient than most Sydney people.\n\nThe faces of Mitch exist for a reason. If I was the same person at work as I am outside of work, I think my bosses would have a bit of a problem with the 24 year-old guy they see trying to climb the corporate ladder. And if I wore my suit out to a beer with my friends, I think they would think I was a bit stiff to be sinking beers.\n\nI have been working so hard since I came to Sydney, it\u2019s definitely a change from the country life. I\u2019ve moved from a rather casual job into a corporate job, from a role without career prospects and a relaxed work ethic into a role with limitless possibilities and challenges. I\u2019ve changed so much as a person and I love the guy I have become.",

The world is in chaos people and only you can stop it. Nothing pisses me off more than standing waiting for the Red \u201cdon\u2019t walk\u201d sign to turn into the Green \u201cyou\u2019ve got 2 seconds, move it\u201d sign, and someone walks up and presses the button.\n\nWhat makes the person think I didn\u2019t hit the button already? And not only do they hit it once, they hit it a few times to make their point heard. I\u2019m sure as they approach the crossing they casually think to themselves, \u2018just in case this guy (who seems to look like he is in a hurry) thought he might stand at the lights for an hour, I am going to press the button\u2026. 8 times!\u2019\n\nThe next time you approach the lights and there are 5 people standing there. Yes YOU, I know YOU do it! Don\u2019t press the button. Seriously, don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s been pressed a million times this week and 31 times in the last minute. The sign knows there are people waiting, it knows you\u2019re in a hurry to get your latte and 3 sushi rolls for lunch while booking in a hair appointment for your boyfriend, Brent. It knows!\n\nShow some patience kids!",

I started a new job a while ago at Michael Page International as an IT Recruitment Consultant. Moving from home was a bit scary, just tossing in my job and taking my chances, but it\u2019s completely paid off in full. I feel like for the first time I\u2019ve trusted myself and given myself a chance to explore who I am and I\u2019m the happiest I can remember being.\n\nWorking in such a high paced environment has it\u2019s good points and it\u2019s bad points. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been bored for a single second since I\u2019ve started and I\u2019m certainly not starved of work, but working so hard is definitely taxing and I don\u2019t get much time during the week to do anything much. Having said that, I get every single Saturday and Sunday off and that is just awesome.\n\nI haven\u2019t had an internet connection since I moved to Sydney, hence the lack of updates on the sit, but hopefully I\u2019ll remedy that very shortly and be able to write here a little more often. I\u2019m also planning on either finishing my degree or using the credit points to a new degree via Open University, so that is going to take even more of my time.\n\nAlso, Claire and I have been together for a year in a few days. I can\u2019t believe how happy I am \u2013 I honestly feel like everything is coming together and I owe so much of it to her. Being in Sydney, the new job, I owe it all to Claire and I think she knows it.",

Hell, I\u2019ve even updated my GeoTags in this webpage, now that is so Hardcore Geek\u2122!\n\nSunday was my last day of work and one of the longest days I have ever worked in my entire life. I did practically nothing all day except wander around and get interrogated by everyone about what my plans were once I moved. I got really sick of admitting saying I was flying by the seat of my pants and winging it, but even more sick of being told it was a stupid thing to do.\n\nFinish work at 4:30pm and fly to Sydney at 6:25pm. I didn\u2019t want to waste any time, I\u2019ve been too unhappy here for too long and getting to Sydney was really my only priority at the moment. I said goodbye to my family at the airport, stepped onto the plane and flew into my new life.\n\nWalking into the airport I notice a sign that says, \u201cOne way \u2013 do not turn back.\u201d I find it amusing that I have visited Sydney nearly every week or two for months now and I have never noticed this sign before. It takes significance for the first time and serves as the first thing all day that told me I was doing the right thing.\n\nIn the airport I see Claire smiling at me, she is absolutely exhausted from filming and she walks over and gives me a tired hug. We\u2019re both exhausted, but still excited, so it\u2019s a bit mixed from both of us. We jump the first available cab and hit it straight to my new house and my new life.\n\nDriving into my suburb for the first time is a little scary. It\u2019s not a bad area (or a great area), but the houses look daunting at night and as though they are leaning in on me and suffocating me.\n\nAs we near my new home for the first time the reality of the fact I have never seen the apartment block sets in and I worry that it\u2019s going to be a dump. Claire jokes with me and points to a particularly crummy looking set of apartments and says, \u201cmaybe that is yours!\u201d It\u2019s amusing, but my apartments that are opposite are really nice! In fact it\u2019s absolutely perfect, it\u2019s amazing! It looks like something out of an O.C./90210 episode, surrounded by palm trees and brand new rendering, much better than I expected!\n\nI drag my bags upstairs and say hello to Rachel and Nikki, two of my housemates. I pile into my room and look around terrified. I really hadn\u2019t considered the unpacking of everything, I needed to unpack so many boxes and build my bed before I could even do anything. A few hours later after a lot of effort, chinese good and building I am sound asleep, dreaming of the days to come in my new life.",

                "text": "# No Junk Mail\n\nCategory: Rant\nDate: August 7, 2006\n\nSpam is a funny thing in a day like today, it makes one wonder about the point. With spam filtration so paranoid that when I send a photo to a friend via e-mail it gets sent to their hotmail spambox, how spammers hope for their e-mail to be read really makes one wonder. I receive, on average, around 100-200 spam e-mails a week to my G-Mail account and approximately 1% actually make it to my inbox. With statistics like that I honestly wonder why spammers bother and what kind of possible success they hope to receive from it.\n\nThis morning I looked in my spambox and checked that nothing important had been caught and noticed the trends happening in trying to get the spam e-mails received by the recipient. Things such as \u201cRe:\u201d at the beginning of the e-mail would probably work on a bad spam-protection system, but G-Mail is obviously smart enough to know that the originating e-mail wasn\u2019t sent, so therefor a reply would be impossible.\n\nThe next trend I notice was a little dash of l33t-sp34k (elite speak). Obviously no one wants an e-mail about \u201cviagra\u201d but \u201cv1agra\u201d could possibly get through some low level spam scripts. The obvious flaw with this is the fact that most people don\u2019t understand l33t-sp34k and therefor wouldn\u2019t read the e-mail.\n\n> Dear Spammer,\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> No one cares. Take the hint.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> Love always,\n\n>\n\n> Mitch\n\n>\n\n>\n\nJust a quick question for anyone who comments: Just hot long has it been since you opened a spam e-mail by accident and then you were stupid enough to click a link? Have you ever?",

                "text": "# Every day is a new day!\n\nCategory: Personal Blog\nDate: August 2, 2006\n\nToday marks a change in my life. It\u2019s only change one of a series that will happen over the next few months, but it\u2019s a change for a better, happier person. Today I sold my car, a car I have loved for 5 years now, a 2000-model Subaru Impreza WRX. It was a great car to be sure and I know I shall miss it, but the money it\u2019s given me will help me start fresh and start making some healthy positive changes in my life.\n\nNo I\u2019m not broke or in financial trouble, but I do have financial commitments that would be hard to upkeep in the weeks to come without the extra money. Over the next month or two I plan on moving to Sydney and looking for a new job. Moving closer to where some of my friends already are and where some of my friends will be in the future.\n\nI\u2019ve wanted to make this change for a long time now and I\u2019ve always put it off. But I guess now I am at a time where I have different motivations and different priorities. It\u2019s kind of scary making such a big change in life, but I think it needs to be done. So here is my 7-part plan as I see it.\n\n**1.** Sell my car \u2013 *completed!*\n\n**2.** Find a house to live with Rachel and Mark, close to the city\n\n**3.** Leave my current job\n\n**4.** Going-away / birthday party\n\n**5.** Make the move to Sydney\n\n**6.** Find a job more suiting to me and that makes me happier\n\n**7.** Recommence my university and get it back on track\n\nPretty simple when you look at it there, but putting it into action is going to be much tougher. I\u2019m going to try and do as much writing as I can and keep the site up to date, but that in itself is going to be even tougher.\n\nPhotos from my snow vacation with Claire are on my flickr account, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll get much of a chance to go into details. I\u2019ll just say that it was one of the best weeks I\u2019ve had in the last 12 months, it was honestly amazing and very relaxing.",

                "text": "# I FUCKING WON!\n\nCategory: Ego\nDate: June 27, 2006\n\nA few years ago when I registered my first domain name, digitalheroine.com (no longer in use), I received a letter that really got to me. This letter was from a rival domain registrar to Dotster, the company I have chosen to manage all my domains through. This letter offered me \u201ccheaper\u201d domain registration, even though it was in fact far more expensive than the registrar that I was already using.\n\nThis morning a letter arrived from the US and I thought it was going to be another similar letter. I studied the envelope carefully and considered throwing it out until I took a close look and realised it was from [America Online (AOL)](http://www.mailblocks.com/MailblocksShutdown.htm), the mail service I had used and trusted for quite some time.\n\nOne of the things that came about during the time when I was pissed off was a promise from AOL to refund what I had paid for my \u201cPro\u201d account. I went through the steps, filled out the form and never believed for a moment that the day would come that I would actually see my check. So this morning when I go through my bank statements, open up my new books from Amazon and find the letter from AOL, I realize that I\u2019ve don it! I FUCKING WON! I BEAT AOL! I have a check in my hand for $24.95 and the feeling is so satisfying that I am not going to cash it. I will keep it for all time, a tribute to the occasion I managed to get something out of AOL. The bastards.\n\n[![AOL Refind](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/176010576/ \"AOL Refund\")\n\n[![AOL Refund](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/176011631/ \"AOL Refund\")",

Some I have deleted, some I have kept, but here is the list that I have found most useful.\n\n**General/Utility Extensions**\n\n* **[Sage](http://sage.mozdev.org/)** would have to be the best newsreader I have ever used, and the fact it\u2019s *inside* the browser makes it doubly useful.\n\n* **[Foxmarks Bookmark Synchronizer](http://www.foxcloud.com/wiki/Main_Page)** allows me to synchronize my bookmarks between Windows/Linux and my USB drive when I am away from my computer.\n\n* **[Gmail Manager](http://www.longfocus.com/firefox/gmanager/)** notifies me when I receive new e-mail to my Gmail account.\n\n* **[VideoDownloader](http://javimoya.com/blog/youtube_en.php)** is an extension that allows you to save the video files viewed on Youtube, Google Videos etc.\n\n**Blogging Extensions**\n\n* **[JustBlogIt](http://blog.warmbrain.com/justblogit/)** makes writing my A-sides a very simple task. This plugin allows me to make quick entries to my blog, automatically creating the links you see on the right of the website.\n\n* **[del.icio.us](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1532/)** allows me to add links to my del.icio.us account for viewing on the right hand side also.\n\n* **[Google Notebook](http://www.google.com/notebook/)** is what I use to collect notes when I am writing. It\u2019s an online scrapbook of thoughts.\n\n**Development Extensions**\n\n* **[Web Developer](http://chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/)** allows me to live edits of CSS and view valuable information about a website when I am designing.\n\n* **[Colorzilla](http://www.iosart.com/firefox/colorzilla/)**, an eyedropper for a website, it allows me to quickly grab and change colors when I am designing.\n\n* **[MeasureIt](http://www.kevinfreitas.net/extensions/measureit/)** is a plugin I don\u2019t use often, but it helps me when I want to know how wide a div/span is or a banner needs to be.\n\n* **[IE Tab](http://ietab.mozdev.org/)** allows me to see what my site looks like in the shitty browser known as IE.",

Apart from my life being rather busy and sometimes getting in the way when I\u2019d much rather be reading or writing, I am now suffering with a lot of pain in my lower back, which prevents me from sitting in my usual chair at my usual workplace. My workplace is usually my favorite place to be, but right now the only option I have is bringing my laptop to my couch and sitting in front of the television while I work, which can be distracting.\n\nIn honor of trying to write more I have made *bananas on toast* my Firefox homepage. I\u2019ve been so slack in updating the website lately that I am hoping that if I log in often enough and see my last entry was a while ago it will encourage me to write more.\n\nThe weekend saw the lame-ass Show come to town, with pathetic rides and freakish carnies along with it! Small hands, cabbage-like smells wafting through the air and annoying \u201cthrow a dart, win the lady a stuffed toy\u201d comments from the carny-ally. It also saw Claire coming back from Sydney for the weekend, something that couldn\u2019t have made me any happier, she is honestly so awesome.\n\nIt was an interesting weekend, hanging with friends and Claire and just having a nice time. Now I have to deal with Claire being back in Sydney and missing her like crazy, but I will see her soon enough. I\u2019m just waiting now for the University holidays to begin when we\u2019ll be back together for a little while.",

Just now while browsing through my normal geek sites I have found two new awesome links. Normally I would just throw these into the A-sides on the right, but I figured this deserved a bit of a mention.\n\nFirstly, a program called [Blender](http://www.blender.org/). From the site: *\u201cBlender is the open source software for 3D modeling, animation, rendering, post-production, interactive creation and playback. Available for all major operating systems under the GNU General Public License.\u201d* I\u2019ve just downloaded it and I\u2019ll probably give it a look-see, but it\u2019s interesting to note since it was used to create the movie in the second link.\n\n[Elephants Dream](http://www.elephantsdream.org/) is a movie created entirely with free software, Blender. Right now their site is in a minimal state, providing only download links and not much else, however the idea alone has me really enthralled. Download it and have a watch, it can\u2019t hurt.",

To boil it down into Mitch-speak, it basically means in geek terms making your life simpler, more efficient and getting the most from yourself.\n\nRecently things have gotten a little insane with my life, so anything that will make it less hectic and help it gel a little easier is a welcome addition. I\u2019m planning on doing a lot of reading and making some hacks to my lifestyle to make things a little easier.\n\nMy current life update includes, but is not limited to:\n\n* Starting up a design business with [Mik](http://www.mikmorley.com/). More to come on that when we finally launch!\n\n* Working my ass off on design, writing, reading, learning and general day to day work.\n\n* Trying to get the most of of unruly sleep patterns, with me sleeping only around 4 hours a night of decent sleep but spending most of the day half-asleep.\n\n* Eating shanks! (I\u2019ll write an entry about that soon)\n\n* Seeing [Claire](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/sets/72057594079513616/) in Sydney and going to weddings.\n\n* Trying to finish The Davinci Code\n\n* Doing some major reading on Lifehacking, obviously.\n\n* Checking out PDA\u2019s, if anyone has advice tell me!\n\nI really need to pull my laptop out of the router, take it away for a while and do some writing. That is the number one thing on my agenda for tomorrow, aside from riding my beautiful bike. As for now, I am going to eat some ice cream, watch some Star Trek and hopefully fall asleep.

I think I like these games more for the memories that they bring up.\n\nSuper Mario Kart reminds me of playing in early high school years with my buddies. I think I was the last of all the guys to ever play, which put me at a bit of a disadvantage and I got my ass handed to me a few times, but it wasn\u2019t long until I got a handle on Toad and began whooping ass myself. Sleepovers, playing SNES until midnight, those were the days!\n\n007: Goldeneye was later high school. We played the game *literally* every single day, we\u2019d meet at a friends house close to my high school and play until well into roll call time. We played the game in every single mode, with every single cheat and at every single chance. We\u2019d cut class, leave at lunch and do anything to play this game, it was unreal!\n\nIf you go to my deviantART account and look at the comments on [Toad Wins](http://stinkbrown.deviantart.com/)) you will read, *\u201cMan toad sucks and everyone knows it, even you know it. You know that Regan as Wario will always rule!!! A-hahahahahahaha! Personally I was always more of a Yoshi man on the old Mario Kart 64, Top A style!\u201d* Top A was the floor I lived on at college and we had the most hardcore Mario Kart 64 lust ever imagined. I mean, we played it more than I played 007: Goldeneye back in high school. We\u2019d play every chance we had and even create mock tournaments to give ourselves an excuse to consume alcohol and have some laughs!\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for some excuse to waste some time, hit eBay and buy yourself some games so you can use the roms. It\u2019s probably the most fun you\u2019ll have without the purchase of a donkey!\n\n[![//www.flickr.com/people/bananasontoast/ on flickr.com](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/140110222/ \"photo sharing\")\n\n[Super Mario Kart](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/ \"View Mitch Malone's photos\").\n\n[![//www.flickr.com/people/bananasontoast/ on flickr.com](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/140110432/ \"photo sharing\")\n\n[Mario Kart 64](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/ \"View Mitch Malone's photos\").",

                "text": "# Paranoia Lurks\n\nCategory: How to...\nDate: May 2, 2006\n\nI remember learning to hack in high school and to circumvent certain Windows and \\*nix security by my computer teacher, Mr. Smith (no the name isn\u2019t made up). I learned from him the basics of hacking, real hacking. I wasn\u2019t a \u201cl33t hax0r\u201d or a script kiddie, he just insisted it was important to understand these vulnerabilities to be a smarter computer user and to understand computer security. He also insisted that it wasn\u2019t for reading other peoples e-mail or planting malicious code. \u201cThe only secure 100% computer is a computer not connected to the Internet or a LAN, but no computer is secure if you can physically get to it,\u201d I remember him saying.\n\nIn grade 8 we watched two movies; [Sneakers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/). Sneakers has mildly realistic hacking scenes, with Hackers being so far blown out of proportion with a graphical hacking environment that the whole thing is laughable. Both movies shared the same message; true hackers aren\u2019t evil, but hacking can be used for bad things.\n\nThroughout high school most students didn\u2019t use their computer accounts for anything very interesting. Some didn\u2019t have the knowledge or desire to do so, but some knew that I would be able to gain access to their account if I wanted to and feared it. Just for the record; I *could*, but never once did. I found the situation pretty funny considering that I also had administrator access granted to me for the purposes of study, but didn\u2019t bother to tell anyone that.\n\nThe later years of school is when \u201chacking\u201d became a term used almost every night on the news. Stories of how [script kiddies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddies) have bought down a server or managed to guess someones credit card details would circulate, while calling these people \u201chackers.\u201d I knew there was something wrong with this and began to notice that all my online friends who studied hacking began going underground.\n\nHackers began calling themselves Computer Security Experts and script kiddies began calling themselves hackers. The world changed before my eyes and before I knew it The Mentor, someone I was mildly familiar with, was arrested and he wrote the [Hacker Manifesto](http://cybercrimes.net/Property/Hacking/Hacker%20Manifesto/HackerManifesto.html). It talks more about the psychology of a hacker, the curious computer user, but since has been used in films like Hackers.\n\nSuddenly the hacker culture is gone and has been replaced by some form of wannabe culture, a culture that is \u201ctoo cool for school\u201d and has shaped what modern hacking is. The problem with this culture is the fact that it has created a culture in mainstream society of paranoia and it\u2019s the very paranoia that drives these \u201chackers\u201d to succeed. Think of when you were back in high school and your parents would say, \u201cjust ignore them and they\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d\n\nNow the biggest reason I write this is because while looking around digg as I often do, I came across [this news presentation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L33t_speak) as something dangerous to society and encourages parents to do everything short of anally probing their children to make sure they know everything they say and do on the internet.\n\nParents, lighten up for crying out loud, it\u2019s an MSN conversation, not a plot to take over the world. While I understand that the internet makes it slightly easier for children and teens to communicate without their parents knowing, it\u2019s no different than taking the cordless phone to the bedroom, chatting about things out or earshot or at school, or simply making a verbal code for when parents are around. Parents will often talk about \u201cC.H.R.I.S.T.M.A.S.\u201d in front of their children by spelling it out, do they honestly think their children will not one day be smarter than them and find their own ways of communicating in this fashion?\n\nMajority of the acronyms used on the internet are to save time and not to undermine anyone. I would honestly rather write \u201clol @ Dave,\u201d than, \u201coh wow Dave, your humor has gotten me once again and I must admit I just let out a rather loud chortle!\u201d PAW (Parents Are Watching) was around when I was a kid, but I never once had to use it. Why? Because my parents gave me the freedom to explore the internet and enjoy my teenage life without putting a microscope up my ass. And given that fact, I am not an imprisoned hacker and I am a part of a majority, not a minority.\n\nI think most parents these days would remember times when they had done something they didn\u2019t want their parents to know about. I am furthermore sure that at least one of these times their parents nearly found out from a friend, but they managed to give the appropriate signal (a wink of the eye, gesture of the head or just a \u201cshut up\u201d look) to terminate the conversation. Would they seriously deny their children the same adolescence?\n\nHackers, real hackers, are not a danger to society. Internet talk or l33t speak is not a danger to society. Can the world just lighten up a little and take it with the appropriate measure of good sense. It\u2019s the fucking internet, not a terrorist playground!",

Most Saturday nights I am surrounded by my friends at a bar, having laughs and winding down from the week I\u2019ve just had. It\u2019s usually a lot of fun, but it costs a lot of money and usually causes a bit of trouble and sometimes I\u2019d just rather be at home geeking out or visiting [Mik](http://www.mikmorley.com/). Unfortunately I didn\u2019t think early enough to call Mik, but the point remains that I spent the Saturday just gone chilling and geeking out.\n\n**Saturdays agenda:**\n\n**1. Chatting**\n\nI haven\u2019t gotten on MSN and chatted to friends in such a long time. Having a chat to Kevin really made me realise what a great friend I have in him and it felt good to just have a few laughs with him and catch up. Personally, the highlight of the conversation was the finish:\n\n[![) by http://www.flickr.com/people/bananasontoast/ on flickr.com](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/136886231/ \"photo sharing\")\n\n[Be Evil :)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/ \"View Mitch Malone's photos\").\n\nAlso had a nice chat with [Selina](http://sundayx.deviantart.com/) (sundayx), the sweetest and most beautiful London girl there is, she is honestly fantastic!\n\n**2.Designing**\n\nJust put the finishing touched on [MMdN](http://www.mitchmalone.name/) instead. The new site is purely a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and will soon become a portfolio of my online works and projects also.\n\nLooked at some design ideas for the future of *bananas on toast*. I am looking at taking the website back to code and completely redesigning the interface of it, including some exciting new ideas to make the site prettier and easier to navigate. This will be a long time down the track, but it\u2019s exciting none the less.\n\n**3. General Geeking Out**\n\nPlaying PSP, downloading lusic on iTunes, watching Prison Break re-runs on my PC, reading geek news websites, packing my bag full of mp3 goodness for work and watching (oh no, run!)

After playing for a few minutes tonight I soon found I was a lot faster than the guys on the other team and began showing off by speeding past them and stealing the ball. As my confidence lifted so did my game and I was feeling so good I felt it was time to unleash my striking power.\n\nI ran to the top of the box and called for the ball and swung my right leg as hard as I could. I swear to god if I had of been one squilimeter to the left I would have slotted the finest goal ever, but instead I connected ball to an opponents foot and I ended up on my ass.\n\nI can barely sit here and type this, but I had to update and let everyone know that my ass is sorer than that of a 12 year-old at Michael Jackson\u2019s house (any more fans want to attack me?)

If this is some April fools joke that is brewing in the back of the mind of some musical talent agent (i.e. \u201cHahaha, I knew that I could make the world public actually listen to this tool!\u201d), I think it\u2019s safe to say the joke is over.\n\nToday I was walking around the office and overheard the latest awful hit from this crybaby crooning across the speaker system. \u201cGoodbye my lover, goodbye my frie\u2013\u201d I punch at the skip button and I am never so grateful for the rancid sound of Lifehouse. Now, to clarify, I am not a big Lifehouse fan, but hearing them honestly makes me want to dance.\n\nNow before you hit the comment button and type something in his defense, have you seriously listened to the song *You\u2019re Beautiful*? This song describes a girl he saw on a subway and apparently \u201cshared a moment that will last till the end.\u201d I am sure that when 16 year old girls listen to this song and see some super hot Blunt-like guy on a subway somewhere staring at their tits and call it a moment. But in all seriously, he just likes cleavage like most guys, sorry to break your heart.\n\nI think that the song *Goodbye My Lover* would have to take the Worst-Song-In-The-Top-40-For-At-Least-The-Last-6-Times-Mitch-Has-Listened-To-Radio award. I would honestly rather watch [Ashlee Simpson make a fool of herself on Saturday Night Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shit). As if it\u2019s not bad enough that he has to sing, it\u2019s even worse that he has to use this whining tone. I doubt he could sound any more like a crybaby if he tried, it makes me sick.\n\nGo download the album from [Napster](http://limewire.com/) or whatever downloading tool you use, just don\u2019t buy it (I wouldn\u2019t wish that kind of dissatisfying purchase on my worst enemy). Keep it in your **C:\\Music\\Kill Myself Playlist** folder, just in case you ever feel suicidal and ever need the push over the edge. Either that or you can just listen to it and tilt your hat to whatever marketing genius actually brainwashed people into listening to this shite. You choose.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I hold no responsibility for James Blunt driving any reader of *bananas on toast* to suicide. I also do not condone this listening of such appalling music. Furthermore, I cannot be held accountable for any guys going sterile from the complete lack of quaility in this album, it\u2019s just not my fault.\n\n**Update:** Due to the fact I have better things to do with my time than argue with whiney James Blunt fans I have disabled commenting. I guess if you have something further to say on the matter you\u2019ll have to start *your own* stupid website.",

I have a well rehearsed speech that goes something like this: \u201cIt\u2019s mostly for my own benefit, in a way it\u2019s a life story, it just has the advantage that other people can read it and see it take place.\u201d\n\nWhile this is mostly true, it\u2019s not *really* the only reason. I never had another reason to write here until recently when I went and visited Mik and Harmony last week before a party. We had a few drinks and went to a birthday party together where Harmony said to me, \u201cyou know that Mik logs on to your webstie all the time saying \u2018I wanna see what Mitch has been up to!\u2019\u201d\n\nI realised that due to the fact that Mik and I hardly see each other, it was a way of him keeping in check with my life and that made me realise just how many people in my life may not get a chance to catch up with me all the time. Ryan, Mik and Claire to just name a few people who check it out now and then to see what I am up to.\n\nI think that out of anyone who may or may not read my website, Mik reading it makes me the happiest. I miss spending time with Mik so much it\u2019s unbelievable and knowing he enjoys my website just makes me really happy.\n\nConsider this a tribute to the only Rocksar I know, [Mik](http://www.mikmorley.com/) you rule, my brother!\n\n**Note:** If you read this makes sure you comment and make me feel special!",

I found a bill saying that I had around $80 overdue on my account and figured that is why it was large and called my Telco (I won\u2019t drom names) to say \u201cwhassup?!\u201d It turns out that my charges were legitimate and I just use my phone to much, but the coolest thing happened afterwards.\n\nThe operator on the phone asked me politely, \u201cmay I take a few minutes of your time and ask your some questions about your service with [Telco]?\u201d\n\nThis is where I am supposed to say that my capped plan is awesome and I love making phone calls and text I don\u2019t have to pay for and laugh in the operators face. Instead I realize that the only thing I have to look forward to tonight is trying to code some PHP with a headache so I humor him. \u201cSure,\u201d I say smoothly and prepare my replies for when he offers me shitty ways to \u201creduce my bill\u201d.\n\n\u201cHow would you like to pay $10 less per month, get another $300 worth of calls, get less expensive calls, be one of the first to try out the 3G network in Australia, AND get a new [Nokia N70](http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_n70-1153.php) phone?\u201d\n\nMy wit escapes me and my replies all seem like discarded palm cards as I stutter, \u201cwhat\u2019s the catch?\u201d\n\nThe operator laughs and cooly says, \u201cthe same catch we always have here at [Telco], you just have to sign for another 12 months!\u201d\n\nNow, for those of you who are uninitiated: I am a mobile-a-holic. Seriously. I text a lot, I talk a lot and I love the idea of being in touch with people and I use my phone for almost everything. So offering a free phone that has all the latest gadgets to a [technophile](http://www.extremefunnypictures.com/funnypic759.htm).\n\nSo, the three reasons to query your Telco:\n\n1. Cheaper shit\n\n2. New, free and cool phone\n\n3. I won indoor soccer\n\nClearly 3 has nothing to do with anything, but I had to put that in there. Take *that* you little 17 year old twats, we smashed your asses and I feel like such a hero in my own lunchbox!\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nSigning off,\n\nMitch\n\nP.S.

Firstly I have changed the color scheme slightly to give the pages a little more life \u2013 all the colors are now a lot brighter. I also added in a search feature to the right, along with archives to go back into past entries and some other links to make navigating past entries a lot easier.\n\nI think one of the best things about designing websites is choosing the color scheme and adjusting it to perfection. Without a good color scheme the website will give a totally wrong feel and the site will constantly look out of shape. Generally speaking the mood I am usually sets what color I start off with, but the colors I choose to compliment it will always vary. Since my first ever website I have gone through several color schemes, most of which used a black base. Personally I think the color scheme I am on now is the best I have ever used.\n\n[![//www.flickr.com/people/bananasontoast/ on flickr.com](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/111298001/ \"photo sharing\")\n\n[Website Redesign](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/ \"View bananasontoast's photos\").

                "text": "# Great Merlin's Beard!\n\nCategory: Personal Blog\nDate: March 11, 2006\n\nLately so much has been going on that this website has been one of the last things on my mind. Claire and I spent a lot of time together in the weeks leading up to her leaving and we seem to have spent a lot of time (and money) on the phone lately talking to each other. I found out that Mel and Claire both found out about this site and started reading it a short while ago. Hopefully they will leave some comments next time!\n\nI\u2019ve been working on a lot of old University assignments, either re-doing them better or doing ones that I didn\u2019t previously do to get myself back in the swing for going back to University. I am deciding whether to recommence my current degree eiher this semester or next or whether I may start a degree more to what I really want to do. Coding is great and definitely what I want to do and I feel like my current degree concentrates too much on other stuff.\n\nClearly I need to take more time to write, so instead of trying today while I am hungover and tired I will leave this with some photos of Claire and I on our recent weekend together.\n\n[![In the summertime! by http://www.flickr.com/people/bananasontoast/ on flickr.com](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/110769325/ \"photo sharing\")\n\n[In the summertime!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/ \"View bananasontoast's photos\").\n\n[![//www.flickr.com/people/bananasontoast/ on flickr.com](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/110769203/ \"photo sharing\")\n\n[Cheeky](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/ \"View bananasontoast's photos\").",

                "text": "# Saying Goodbye\n\nCategory: Personal Blog\nDate: February 9, 2006\n\nThere are different types of goodbyes that we deal with in our lives, some are temporary and some are permanent, but they all hurt a hell of a lot. Saying goodbye is admitting an end to something and that is never an easy thing.\n\nTonight I sat on the couch watching [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: *The Secret of the Ooze*](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/48970708/)\u2018s girlfriend and one of my best friends) is leaving. No one is really saying much apart from laughing at the few of us (myself included) who actually find the movie a good watch, but everyone is feeling the same. We\u2019re saying goodbye to a friend and it sucks.\n\nRight now I am looking at a time when I will be saying goodbye to lots of friends, some of them the best friends I have ever had in my life. After Uni I said goodbye to people, but it was different because I thought I was coming back, but now I am saying goodbye to friends and I may not see them more than the odd special occasion for several years. Uni can change everything and some of them may come back in love, married or who knows what may change in their lives.\n\nOver the past year two very special girls have always been there for me, [Rachel](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/96297771/). Rachel is a friend who has always been so kind to me and almost like a sister, we\u2019ve never had so much as a disagreement and we have often hung out and had the best times. Claire is someone who has changed my life in so many ways and I doubt I could ever express just how much her friendship has meant to me, she has been there for me in some tough times and I will never forget her.\n\nSo now when Mark walks through the door and is quite obviously rather sad, it becomes more apparent to me that this will happen more and more as life goes on. The friends I have now will eventually find jobs and significant others and lifestyle changes that will drag them away and for all I know I may have a completely different set of friends in another year from now. All I know is that to all the people who I consider a friend (you know who you are), I hope you know just how much I love you all!",

I\u2019ve moved out with two of my best friends, [Mark and Daly](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/69972307/), and it feels really good to be getting out on my own. I spent a hot summers day procrastinating until the last minute and then moving my important belongings within the last 2 hours of the day. It was a fun day and it felt so good to be on my own, but I just ended up passing out while my friends all went out and had a great time.\n\nSince then it has been much more work than play I am afraid, working all day and usually finding myself with so many things to do every afternoon when all I want to do is lay down and watch a movie or catch up on some reading or writing. Right now is the first time I\u2019ve actually had to sit down since last year and suddenly I realise that I have posted only 10 times in over a month and a half and that is really bad considering just how much I enjoy writing here.\n\nSo now that my friends are out at a poker game and I am sitting her by myself listening to [The Get Up Kids](http://www.thegetupkids.com/), I am taking the time to recount the events of recent and all I can think about is sleep. I\u2019m going to drag my lazy butt to bed on the promise to try and write tomorrow. If I don\u2019t start writing soon, I almost have no reason to keep this. Night kids, stay cool!",

                "text": "# I have it in my hand\u2026\n\nCategory: Lik-Wid\nDate: December 6, 2005\n\n\u2026not my dick, the new Lik-Wid album \u201cBreathing For The First Time,\u201d you dirty bastard!\n\nSo I know I have been a bad friend, I know my penis is short and bent, and most of all I know it has taken me far too long to buy a copy of their latest album, but I finally have a copy of the new Lik-Wid CD. This album is by far one of the most inspiring albums I have in my collection. Regardless of how good the music is, which I can tell you it is great, the things that the band has gone through from birth to conception to delivered product is phenomenal. Watching this process has honestly been one of the biggest privileges in my life.\n\nSo earlier this afternoon I had a conversation with Ryan that went like this:\n\n>\n\n> **Mitch:** Hey bro\n\n>\n\n> **Mitch:** Am I allowed to invite people to this thing on the weekend?\n\n>\n\n> **Ryan:** heyman what u doing?\n\n>\n\n> **Mitch:** Mitch much man, day off\n\n>\n\n> **Ryan:** yer man hell yes, i have like 40000 posters we got done ilol have to give u some man\n\n>\n\n> **Ryan:** day off swoit, should of told me yesterday, would of got some beers :)\n\n>\n\n> **Ryan:** well we still can lol\n\n>\n\n> **Mitch:** I got beers here man, imported shit galore, you should come over and have one with me\n\n>\n\n> **Ryan:** yer man sounds good, ill bring some posters n shit for ya 2\n\n>\n\n> **Ryan:** just gotta wait for scoot to get home, he has his keys on him\n\n>\n\n> **Mitch:** No worries man\n\n>\n\n> **Mitch:** Bring me a CD too and I\u2019ll hook you up with some cash. $15?\n\n>\n\n> **Ryan:** yer man np ive got some on me ill bring em with me\n\n>\n\n> **Mitch:** Yeah, hell yeah man!\n\n>\n\n> **Ryan:** swoit\n\n>\n\n> **Ryan:** ill cya in a bit man\n\n>\n\n> **Ryan:** prolly 30min\n\n>\n\n> **Mitch:** Yeah, do it!\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\nAbout an hour later (Ryan must have lost his watch) he arrived at my house and we cracked a beer. We sat and watched the FHM comedy awards and chatted about life and the band. It was great to catch up somewhere other than a bar on the weekend, and I can\u2019t wait to catch up again both tomorrow and Thursday when the guys do an open jam session (not that I haven\u2019t been to a few of their jams before).\n\nI\u2019ve gotten a little off topic here, this entry was supposed to be about whoring out the new Lik-Wid album. Normally I\u2019d try and convince you of the albums quality by doing a track-by-track review, followed by some quotes, and finally an assurance of the music. Instead, I have decided the \u201ccut the crap\u201d so to speak and get straight to the point. Buy the CD and go to the [launch party](http://uat.bananasontoast.org/?p=518) or else! I know a guy, who knows a guy, who played cards with a guys wife, and he assures me he will mess you up proper if you don\u2019t buy the CD. And if that isn\u2019t enough, Granny (Lik-Wid mascot and grandmother) is in major need of a hip transplant \u2013 if the boys don\u2019t raise the funds she will be stuck in bed for the rest of her life.\n\nGo on, have a heart.\n\nHere is a well good shot of the album itself\u2026\n\n[![likwid-cdshot by http://www.flickr.com/people/bananasontoast/ on flickr.com](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/70789197/ \"photo sharing\")\n\n\u2026and a shot of the inside album art, where yours truly gets a mention!\n\n[![likwid-albumart by http://www.flickr.com/people/bananasontoast/ on flickr.com](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/70788675/ \"photo sharing\")\n\nNow, I am going to go eat the rest of my [sundae](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bananasontoast/70793831/).",

Linkin Park are one of those bands who are always doing something and it sometimes becomes hard to keep up with, so I browse their site as often as I can remember. I saw a lot of stuff about Fort Minor and had a look to find that Mike Shinoda has released a new Hip-Hop album. I got a copy of the album a few minutes later via iTunes and all I can say is \u201cwow!\u201d Get it however you can and give it a listen, especially if you are a fan of Mike Shinoda\u2019s lyrical genius.",
